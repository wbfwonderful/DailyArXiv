| **[Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made prematurely.

| **[Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e., automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/PANDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUAL-VAD: Dual Benchmarks and Anomaly-Focused Sampling for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11605v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety. However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task. Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages in IEEE double-column format, 1 figure, 5 tables.

| **[Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA-Crime: A Synthetic Dataset and Generation Framework for Fatal Violence Detection with Adversarial Snippet-Level Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08232v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset and the data generation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |
| **[A Survey on Video Anomaly Detection via Deep Learning: Human, Vehicle, and Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14203v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GV-VAD : Exploring Video Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00312v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DAMS:Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20629v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |

| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%).

| **[SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTimeCoT: Thinking by Drawing for Video Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14672v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs, which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips, resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight).

To achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 34 pages, 25 figures |
| **[VideoLucy: Deep Memory Backtracking for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12422v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding. EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as GPT-4o.

| **[K-frames: Scene-Driven Any-k Keyframe Selection for long video understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13891v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations. Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data & Code: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ExpVid</p></details> |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20 representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.</p></details> |  |

Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro), video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines.</p></details> |  |

They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling.

However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM), which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal robustness.</p></details> |  |

This lack of transparency and failure to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features, grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages + 15 Supplementary Material Pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain limited to specific clothes types and tasks, due to the complex, high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes manipulation over diverse clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long dresses, ..., as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, .... The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints-e.g., ''left sleeve'' and ''right shoulder''-a sparse spatial-semantic representation, salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective representation for a wide range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints as an intermediate representation to connect high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a set of pre-built manipulation skills conditioned on the keypoints. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four distinct tasks-folding, flattening, hanging, and placing-confirm CLASP's performance on real-life clothes manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark.

| **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-Language Alignment Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10921v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Detect Unknown Jailbreak Attacks in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15430v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Learning-to-Detect-51CB.</p></details> |  |
| **[HumorDB: Can AI understand graphical humor?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13564v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in image segmentation and object detection, understanding complex scenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

| **[Fine-Tuning MedGemma for Clinical Captioning to Enhance Multimodal RAG over Malaysia CPGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15418v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following Models Need for Efficient Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03409v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications.

Existing supervised fine-tuning methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 figures,</p></details> |
| **[VITA-VLA: Efficiently Teaching Vision-Language Models to Act via Action Expert Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09607v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://ltbai.github.io/VITA-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[Scope: Selective Cross-modal Orchestration of Visual Perception Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence. Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[FLEX: A Largescale Multimodal, Multiview Dataset for Learning Structured Representations for Fitness Action Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03198v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action Quality Assessment (AQA) -- the task of quantifying how well an action is performed -- has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

| **[General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17462v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed information flows, limiting their generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge for reasoning and planning, but prior LVLM-robot integrations have largely depended on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and rigid control logic. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools drawn from modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select navigation actions. This agentic formulation enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, offering a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA outperforms state-of-the-art EQA-specific approaches. Qualitative results on RxR and custom tasks further demonstrate its ability to generalize across a broad range of navigation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Forcing: Implicit Spatial Representation Alignment for Vision-language-action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12276v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions. However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on 2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of depth estimators. We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial representations that enhance action precision. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/</p></details> |  |

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.</p></details> | Corrected typos |

Yet we still lack a clear, language-focused evaluation framework to test how well agents ground the words in their instructions. We address this gap by proposing LangNav, an open-vocabulary multi-object navigation dataset with natural language goal descriptions (e.g. 'go to the red short candle on the table') and corresponding fine-grained linguistic annotations (e.g., attributes: color=red, size=short; relations: support=on). These labels enable systematic evaluation of language understanding. To evaluate on this setting, we extend multi-object navigation task setting to Language-guided Multi-Object Navigation (LaMoN), where the agent must find a sequence of goals specified using language. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a novel method that builds a queryable, multi-layered semantic map from pretrained vision-language features and proves effective for reasoning over fine-grained attributes and spatial relations in goal descriptions. Experiments on LangNav show that MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot mapping-based navigation baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 27 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing evaluations focus on passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on multimodal active reasoning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code will be released at https://ruoyuchen10.github.io/EAGLE/.</p></details> |  |

However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.</p></details> |  |

We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

While humans consistently demonstrate structural priming effects across various linguistic contexts, it remains unclear whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit similar syntactic preservation behaviors. We introduce PRISMATIC, the first multimodal structural priming dataset, which advances computational linguistics by providing a standardized benchmark for investigating syntax-vision interactions. We propose the Syntactic Preservation Index (SPI), a novel reference-free evaluation metric designed specifically to assess structural priming effects in sentence level. Using this metric, we constructed and tested models with two different multimodal encoding architectures to investigate their structural preservation capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that models with both encoding methods show comparable syntactic priming effects. However, only fusion-encoded models exhibit robust positive correlations between priming effects and visual similarity, suggesting a cognitive process more aligned with human psycholinguistic patterns. This work provides new insights into evaluating and understanding how syntactic information is processed in multimodal language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Comics for Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Structured Visual Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15068v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15050v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts. Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some (e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment. DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wikichao.github.io/DRIFT/</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[You May Speak Freely: Improving the Fine-Grained Visual Recognition Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models with Answer Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14885v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV26. 12 pages, 8 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14866v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in the project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRubric-R1V: Rubric-Based Generative Rewards for Faithful Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14738v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTimeCoT: Thinking by Drawing for Video Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14672v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process.

| **[ColorBench: Benchmarking Mobile Agents with Graph-Structured Framework for Complex Long-Horizon Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14621v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However, real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental results.

| **[Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations. To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into multiple MLLM families. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

| **[MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17692v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Oral).

| **[From Perception to Cognition: A Survey of Vision-Language Interactive Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25373v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14374v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.
