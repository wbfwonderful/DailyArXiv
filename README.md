| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 |
| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version has been removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus on the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with significantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding without requiring training on long video data. The code and data examples are available at https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Sparrow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Sparrow</p></details> |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold.

This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously.

| **[Q-Frame: Query-aware Frame Selection and Multi-Resolution Adaptation for Video-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22139v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[AV-Reasoner: Improving and Benchmarking Clue-Grounded Audio-Visual Counting for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05328v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains. The code and benchmark have been released on https://av-reasoner.github.io.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Unlike event cameras, which record changes in light intensity to capture motion, spike cameras provide even finer spatiotemporal resolution and a more precise representation of continuous changes. In this paper, we introduce the first video action recognition (VAR) dataset using spike camera, alongside synchronized RGB and thermal modalities, to enable comprehensive benchmarking for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By preserving the inherent sparsity and temporal precision of spiking data, our three datasets offer a unique platform for exploring multimodal video understanding and serve as a valuable resource for directly comparing spiking, thermal, and RGB modalities. This work contributes a novel dataset that will drive research in energy-efficient, ultra-low-power video understanding, specifically for action recognition tasks using spike-based data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynImg: Key Frames with Visual Prompts are Good Representation for Multi-Modal Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15569v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent. However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Visual Planning with Auxiliary Tasks and Multi-token Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15130v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan, achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets, surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3 future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

In video understanding, correctness ensures the accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans. Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises 1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four adversarial questions that probe visual and narrative complexity. Our evaluation shows a significant gap between video LLMs and human performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; Project page: https://zhangyuanhan-ai.github.io/video-tt/</p></details> |
| **[Generalist Forecasting with Frozen Video Models via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13942v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13609v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding. Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR) into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking, spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance: LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal (+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for improving compositional video reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoITG: Multimodal Video Understanding with Instructed Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13353v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench.

While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Vidi: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15681v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calisthenics Skills Temporal Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12245v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics. To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, In Proceedings of the 19th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 2</p></details> |
| **[Vamba: Understanding Hour-Long Videos with Hybrid Mamba-Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11579v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Camera Ready Version.

However, existing video captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric, overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight, capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets, UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities, featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in unconstrained real-world UGC settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mxllc.github.io/EmbRACE-3K/</p></details> |

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.</p></details> |  |

While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

However, since LVLMs are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues, this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward. Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively. Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy training.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging GPU Burn, Weights and Biases, and IPMItool, we collect detailed thermal, power, and computation data. Results show that the liquid-cooled systems maintain GPU temperatures between 41-50 degrees Celsius, while the air-cooled counterparts fluctuate between 54-72 degrees Celsius under load. This thermal stability of liquid-cooled systems yields 17 percent higher performance (54 TFLOPs per GPU vs. 46 TFLOPs per GPU), improved performance per watt, reduced energy overhead, and greater system efficiency than the air-cooled counterparts. These findings underscore the energy and sustainability benefits of liquid cooling, offering a compelling path forward for hyperscale data centers s</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

Models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLama can use images to understand and analyze complex visual scenes. 3D objects and shapes are the basic building blocks of the world, recognizing them is a fundamental part of human perception. The goal of this work is to test whether LVLMs truly understand 3D shapes by testing the models ability to identify and match objects of the exact same 3D shapes but with different orientations and materials/textures. A large number of test images were created using CGI with a huge number of highly diverse objects, materials, and scenes. The results of this test show that the ability of such models to match 3D shapes is significantly below humans but much higher than random guesses. Suggesting that the models have gained some abstract understanding of 3D shapes but still trail far beyond humans in this task. Mainly it seems that the models can easily identify the same object with a different orientation as well as matching identical 3D shapes of the same orientation but with different materials and textures. However, when both the object material and orientation are changed, all models perform poorly relative to humans. Code and benchmark are available.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations.

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach.</p></details> |  |

However, current vision-language models in EO, particularly CLIP-based variants, remain confined to individual modalities, limiting generalization and scalability across diverse tasks. We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands. Together, these contributions establish a scalable foundation for multimodal EO understanding and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous EO data with large language models. Code and datasets will be released. Code and datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code & weights: https://github.com/xiong-zhitong/DOFA-CLIP</p></details> |

This work investigates how Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, which provide rigorous coverage guarantees, can enhance the reliability of state-of-the-art human action recognition (HAR) systems built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We demonstrate that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails which can hinder their practical utility. To mitigate this, we propose tuning the temperature of the softmax prediction, without using additional calibration data. This work contributes to ongoing efforts for multi-modal human-AI interaction in dynamic real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to ICIP 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

Multimodal methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods, demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial 3D-LLM: Exploring Spatial Awareness in 3D Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16524v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

However, these visualizations and contextual images typically remain separated, limiting their combined narrative expressiveness and engagement. Achieving this is challenging due to the need for fine-grained alignment and creative ideation. To address this, we present SceneLoom, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-powered system that facilitates the coordination of data visualization with real-world imagery based on narrative intents. Through a formative study, we investigated the design space of coordination relationships between data visualization and real-world scenes from the perspectives of visual alignment and semantic coherence. Guided by the derived design considerations, SceneLoom leverages VLMs to extract visual and semantic features from scene images and data visualization, and perform design mapping through a reasoning process that incorporates spatial organization, shape similarity, layout consistency, and semantic binding. The system generates a set of contextually expressive, image-driven design alternatives that achieve coherent alignments across visual, semantic, and data dimensions. Users can explore these alternatives, select preferred mappings, and further refine the design through interactive adjustments and animated transitions to support expressive data communication. A user study and an example gallery validate SceneLoom's effectiveness in inspiring creative design and facilitating design externalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeC: Advancing Complex Video Object Segmentation via Progressive Concept Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15852v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/ ; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC ; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Safety Realignment: Lightweight Restoration of Safety in Pruned Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16104v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road safety assessments are critical yet costly, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where most roads remain unrated. Traditional methods require expert annotation and training data, while supervised learning-based approaches struggle to generalise across regions. In this paper, we introduce \textit{V-RoAst}, a zero-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to classify road safety attributes defined by the iRAP standard. We introduce the first open-source dataset from ThaiRAP, consisting of over 2,000 curated street-level images from Thailand annotated for this task. We evaluate Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini on this dataset and benchmark their performance against VGGNet and ResNet baselines. While VLMs underperform on spatial awareness, they generalise well to unseen classes and offer flexible prompt-based reasoning without retraining. Our results show that VLMs can serve as automatic road assessment tools when integrated with complementary data. This work is the first to explore VLMs for zero-shot infrastructure risk assessment and opens new directions for automatic, low-cost road safety mapping.

| **[Multi-modal vision-language model for generalizable annotation-free pathology localization and clinical diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02044v6)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defining pathologies automatically from medical images aids the understanding of the emergence and progression of diseases, and such an ability is crucial in clinical diagnostics. However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We conducted primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images, and performed extensive validation across 8 external datasets encompassing 34 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assessed the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. Extensive experiments show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quality Text, Robust Vision: The Role of Language in Enhancing Visual Robustness of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data, and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance. To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods -- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 Accepted |

This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025; 19 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Fine-grained video editing is crucial for enabling precise, object-level modifications while maintaining context and temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce FiVE, a Fine-grained Video Editing Benchmark for evaluating emerging diffusion and rectified flow models. Our benchmark includes 74 real-world videos and 26 generated videos, featuring 6 fine-grained editing types, 420 object-level editing prompt pairs, and their corresponding masks. Additionally, we adapt the latest rectified flow (RF) T2V generation models, Pyramid-Flow and Wan2.1, by introducing FlowEdit, resulting in training-free and inversion-free video editing models Pyramid-Edit and Wan-Edit. We evaluate five diffusion-based and two RF-based editing methods on our FiVE benchmark using 15 metrics, covering background preservation, text-video similarity, temporal consistency, video quality, and runtime. To further enhance object-level evaluation, we introduce FiVE-Acc, a novel metric leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to assess the success of fine-grained video editing. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-based editing significantly outperforms diffusion-based methods, with Wan-Edit achieving the best overall performance and exhibiting the least sensitivity to hyperparameters.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

We assess the open-source models InternVL 2.5, Qwen 2.5 VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, finding that even the latest models struggle to reliably distinguish physically plausible from implausible scenarios. To go beyond performance metrics, we conduct a probing analysis of model embeddings, extracting intermediate representations at key processing stages to examine how well task-relevant information is preserved. Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical vision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture physical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by the language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment suggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not the vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic information. Our findings highlight vision-language alignment as a key area for improvement, offering insights for future MLLMs development.</p></details> |  |
| **[C2-Evo: Co-Evolving Multimodal Data and Model for Self-Improving Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16518v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus on the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with significantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding without requiring training on long video data.

| **[MC-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Context Visual Grounding in the Era of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12332v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary vision-language understanding capabilities, their abilities to solve instance-level visual-language problems beyond a single image warrant further exploration. To assess these unproven abilities of MLLMs, this paper proposes a new visual grounding task called multi-context visual grounding, which aims to localize instances of interest across multiple images based on open-ended text prompts. In order to facilitate this research, we construct a new dataset MC-Bench that features 2K high-quality and manually annotated samples. Each sample consists of an instance-level labeled image pair and a corresponding text prompt that indicates the target instances in the images. These text prompts are highly open-ended and follow three distinct styles, covering 20 practical skills. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and foundation models with potential multi-context visual grounding capabilities, along with our developed simple yet effective agentic baseline and a finetuned baseline by multi-context instruction tuning. Our evaluation reveals a non-trivial performance gap between existing MLLMs and humans, along with some insightful observations that suggest potential future directions. We hope that MC-Bench and our empirical findings encourage the research community to further advance the untapped potentials of MLLMs in instance-level tasks, particularly in multi-image contexts.

| **[PEBench: A Fictitious Dataset to Benchmark Machine Unlearning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12545v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks, but their reliance on vast, internet-sourced data raises significant privacy and security concerns. Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a critical technique to address these issues, enabling the selective removal of targeted information from pre-trained models without costly retraining. However, the evaluation of MU for MLLMs remains inadequate. Existing benchmarks often lack a comprehensive scope, focusing narrowly on entities while overlooking the unlearning of broader visual concepts and the inherent semantic coupling between them. To bridge this gap, we introduce, PEBench, a novel benchmark designed to facilitate a thorough assessment of MU in MLLMs. PEBench features a fictitious dataset of personal entities and corresponding event scenes to evaluate unlearning across these distinct yet entangled concepts. We leverage this benchmark to evaluate five MU methods, revealing their unique strengths and weaknesses. Our findings show that unlearning one concept can unintentionally degrade performance on related concepts within the same image, a challenge we term cross-concept interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the difficulty of unlearning person and event concepts simultaneously and propose an effective method to mitigate these conflicting objectives. The source code and benchmark are publicly available at https://pebench.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[LOCOFY Large Design Models -- Design to code conversion solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16208v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous challenges related to interpretability, scalability, resource requirements and repeatability remain, related to their application in the design-to-code space. To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models (LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless conversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models illustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a novel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior performance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning, responsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and feature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in identifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our proposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs that subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable production-ready code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt4Trust: A Reinforcement Learning Prompt Augmentation Framework for Clinically-Aligned Confidence Calibration in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09279v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

| **[SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring How Generative MLLMs Perceive More Than CLIP with the Same Vision Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05195v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025; 19 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[True Multimodal In-Context Learning Needs Attention to the Visual Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15807v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

| **[Surfacing Variations to Calibrate Perceived Reliability of MLLM-generated Image Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15692v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide new opportunities for blind and low vision (BLV) people to access visual information in their daily lives. However, these models often produce errors that are difficult to detect without sight, posing safety and social risks in scenarios from medication identification to outfit selection. While BLV MLLM users use creative workarounds such as cross-checking between tools and consulting sighted individuals, these approaches are often time-consuming and impractical. We explore how systematically surfacing variations across multiple MLLM responses can support BLV users to detect unreliable information without visually inspecting the image. We contribute a design space for eliciting and presenting variations in MLLM descriptions, a prototype system implementing three variation presentation styles, and findings from a user study with 15 BLV participants. Our results demonstrate that presenting variations significantly increases users' ability to identify unreliable claims (by 4.9x using our approach compared to single descriptions) and significantly decreases perceived reliability of MLLM responses. 14 of 15 participants preferred seeing variations of MLLM responses over a single description, and all expressed interest in using our system for tasks from understanding a tornado's path to posting an image on social media.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning on Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While the diffusion model (DM) has been broadly deployed in public over the past few years, the understanding of its backdoor vulnerability is still in its infancy compared to the extensive studies in discriminative models. Recently, many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, but a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning on DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thorough evaluations of the existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose \textit{BackdoorDM}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning on DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and three useful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on multimodal large language model (MLLM). Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Visual Facts from Intermediate Layers for Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15652v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs. However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers. Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly, EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DOGR: Towards Versatile Visual Document Grounding and Referring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17125v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |

In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing alternatives typically require either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets. Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences.
