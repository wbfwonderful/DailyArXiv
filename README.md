| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at https://github.com/EavnJeong/IEF-VAD.</p></details> |  |

| **[LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01945v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources.

However, existing methods often tend to dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for autonomous driving applications. The code is available at https://github.com/SixCorePeach/MCAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Appearance: Geometric Cues for Robust Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05948v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) fundamentally struggles with pervasive challenges including object occlusions, motion blur, and appearance variations during temporal association. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Event Reasoning and Prediction by Fusing World Knowledge from LLMs with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05822v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video understanding models excel at recognizing "what" is happening but fall short in high-level cognitive tasks like causal reasoning and future prediction, a limitation rooted in their lack of commonsense world knowledge. To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[IPFormer-VideoLLM: Enhancing Multi-modal Video Understanding for Multi-shot Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21116v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Video LLMs Refuse to Answer? Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04976v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[PEVLM: Parallel Encoding for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19651v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, their application to long video understanding remains hindered by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{PEVLM}, a fine-tuning-free parallel encoding method designed to enhance the prefilling efficiency of VLMs in long video scenarios. PEVLM partitions the input video into context blocks with a shared sink block, while preserving sequential position embeddings to align the attention weight distribution with that of Full-Attention. This design reduces attention complexity from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ where $T$ is the number of frames and $N$ the number of tokens per frame, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art models and benchmarks demonstrate that PEVLM consistently outperforms existing parallel encoding approaches, achieving up to \textbf{7.47x} speedup in attention computation and reducing end-to-end latency by \textbf{40\%}. Remarkably, PEVLM not only maintains high accuracy, but in some settings even surpasses Full-Attention performance. Under strict latency constraints, it achieves substantial gains, improving accuracy from \textbf{23.26\%} to \textbf{61.03\%}. These results underscore the effectiveness of PEVLM for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Videos often have a larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones. Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |

However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic, leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model, trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5% relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the 11th IEEE International Workshop on Computer Vision in Sports (CVSports) at CVPR 2025; supplementary appendix included</p></details> |

We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1) Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task, which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized domains and provides a new direction for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video, image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines, with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to robustness and performance.</p></details> |  |

In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework designed to enhance video quality understanding on the short-video platform while optimizing computational efficiency. Our approach integrates an entropy-based pre-filtering stage, where a lightweight model assesses uncertainty and selectively filters cases before passing them to the more computationally intensive MLLM for final evaluation. By prioritizing high-uncertainty samples for deeper analysis, our framework significantly reduces GPU usage while maintaining the strong classification performance of a full MLLM deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deploy this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at the short-video platform, and perform a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains from the offline evaluation in these two tasks and effectively enhances platform safety with limit resource consumption, significantly reducing inappropriate content video view rate by 9.9% in a online A/B test without affecting engagement. Post-launch monitoring confirmed sustained improvements, validating its real-world impact.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report: https://github.com/Kwai-Keye/Keye</p></details> |

Our system can transform images from extremely low resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at 256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery, fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g., NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research communities.

This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.</p></details> |  |

Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However, our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e., when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized (leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIAP25.

Yet, their effectiveness in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data. Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While preference optimization can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale. Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences, eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.</p></details> |  |

A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual Grounding Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06899v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[HVI-CIDNet+: Beyond Extreme Darkness for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06814v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts. Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+ (HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+ leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions, ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages |

This study develops high-performing OCR systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data, while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing resources.

| **[Text-promptable Object Counting via Quantity Awareness Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06679v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness. Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability for zero-shot class-agnostic counting.

However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos, collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually created test set of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based dynamic slide generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appen...</summary><p>Appendix at: https://github.com/PAMPAS-Lab/ANA-PPT-Anamation/blob/main/Appendix.pdf</p></details> |

Although vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning (CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts. CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text. These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.</p></details> |  |

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Integrated Structural Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05677v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning methods have significantly extended the transferability of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide text or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works ignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within and between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new classes remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of information representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces self-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural relationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across modalities. This enables efficient information transfer while preserving feature stability. Additionally, we propose a sample probing module that dynamically adjusts loss coefficients based on sample difficulty, preventing the mode from overfitting to simple samples and improving generalization ability to new classes. Extensive experiments on three widely used settings: base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization demonstrate that the proposed ISP achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bilateral Collaboration with Large Vision-Language Models for Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06510v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image, even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations. However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained, which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG) component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The code will be released in Github.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Their effectiveness, however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity, presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and (2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based metrics--Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity--that move beyond accuracy. These metrics shed light on how different descriptor generation strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering new ways to study descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.</p></details> | VisCon @ CVPR 2025 |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |

Its key innovation lies in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens, which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training. Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities. Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Multimodal Understanding via Stable Diffusion as a Task-Aware Feature Extractor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07106v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |

Exploring Visual Correspondence Shortcomings of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04670v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding. However, the visual matching ability of MLLMs is rarely studied, despite finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in computer vision. Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent MLLMs still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation. To our knowledge, this is the first visual corresponding dataset and benchmark for the MLLM community. Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy. The former learns instance discriminative tokens, while the latter further improves instruction following ability. CoLVA-InternVL2-4B achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 49.80\% on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and the best open-source MLLM, Qwen2VL-72B, by 7.15\% and 11.72\% OA, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs. Code, benchmark, dataset, and models will be released.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

A rate shift is needed to extract data from specimen images efficiently, moving beyond human-mediated transcription. We developed `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline) using advanced computer vision techniques to extract pre-catalogue data from primary specimen labels on herbarium specimens. Hespi integrates two object detection models: one for detecting the components of the sheet and another for fields on the primary primary specimen label. It classifies labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or mixed and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for extraction. The text is then corrected against authoritative taxon databases and refined using a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text from specimen sheets across international herbaria, and its modular design allows users to train and integrate custom models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, they often suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in both text and video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepTalk: Towards Seamless and Smart Speech Interaction with Adaptive Modality-Specific MoE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21864v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency. All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful insights to the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[TalkFashion: Intelligent Virtual Try-On Assistant Based on Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05790v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on has made significant progress in recent years. This paper addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings, enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the current methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Fine-Grained Knowledge Structuring and Retrieval for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20964v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural language questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong performance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing domain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs), referred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless, conventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual descriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address these challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce fine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g. text fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than merely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization and management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process itself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit retrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates fine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures precise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning capabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods across four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3% and up to 11% in the best case.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCode$^2$: Cascaded Large-scale Codebooks for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20214v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MLlm-DR: Towards Explainable Depression Recognition with MultiModal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05591v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05386v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Edits: X-Planner for Complex Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05259v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly introduced complex editing benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://danielchyeh.github.io/x-planner/</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2) recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a "spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed method significantly improves results compared to prior work.

| **[Transfer Attack for Bad and Good: Explain and Boost Adversarial Transferability across Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20090v4)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modality interaction, yet they also suffer adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, the transferability of adversarial examples remains an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we specifically analyze the manifestation of adversarial transferability among MLLMs and identify the key factors that influence this characteristic. We discover that the transferability of MLLMs exists in cross-LLM scenarios with the same vision encoder and indicate \underline{\textit{two key Factors}} that may influence transferability. We provide two semantic-level data augmentation methods, Adding Image Patch (AIP) and Typography Augment Transferability Method (TATM), which boost the transferability of adversarial examples across MLLMs. To explore the potential impact in the real world, we utilize two tasks that can have both negative and positive societal impacts: \ding{182} Harmful Content Insertion and \ding{183} Information Protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[FUDOKI: Discrete Flow-based Unified Understanding and Generation via Kinetic-Optimal Velocities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20147v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Can Video LLMs Refuse to Answer? Alignment for Answerability in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04976v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[ReLoop: "Seeing Twice and Thinking Backwards" via Closed-loop Training to Mitigate Hallucinations in Multimodal understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04943v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |
| **[HV-MMBench: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[From Imitation to Innovation: The Emergence of AI Unique Artistic Styles and the Challenge of Copyright Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04769v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.</p></details> |  |
