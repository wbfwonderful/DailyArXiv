| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: (i) for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences; (ii) regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analysis, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. Some experimentations are been made to compare these two architectural configurations with each other, and evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis and surveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. To address these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires no training and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible.

However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Camera-ready Version</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Temporal Grounding Video LLM via Causal Event Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05643v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents video LLM outputs as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE process visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, existing egocentric video representation learning methods mainly focus on aligning video representation with high-level narrations, overlooking the intricate dynamics between hands and objects. In this work, we aim to integrate the modeling of fine-grained hand-object dynamics into the video representation learning process. Since no suitable data is available, we introduce HOD, a novel pipeline employing a hand-object detector and a large language model to generate high-quality narrations with detailed descriptions of hand-object dynamics. To learn these fine-grained dynamics, we propose EgoVideo, a model with a new lightweight motion adapter to capture fine-grained hand-object motion information. Through our co-training strategy, EgoVideo effectively and efficiently leverages the fine-grained hand-object dynamics in the HOD data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric downstream tasks, including improvements of 6.3% in EK-100 multi-instance retrieval, 5.7% in EK-100 classification, and 16.3% in EGTEA classification in zero-shot settings.

| **[Q-Bench-Video: Benchmarking the Video Quality Understanding of LMMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20063v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rising interest in research on Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for video understanding, many studies have emphasized general video comprehension capabilities, neglecting the systematic exploration into video quality understanding. To address this oversight, we introduce Q-Bench-Video in this paper, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' proficiency in discerning video quality. a) To ensure video source diversity, Q-Bench-Video encompasses videos from natural scenes, AI-generated Content (AIGC), and Computer Graphics (CG). b) Building on the traditional multiple-choice questions format with the Yes-or-No and What-How categories, we include Open-ended questions to better evaluate complex scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate the video pair quality comparison question to enhance comprehensiveness. c) Beyond the traditional Technical, Aesthetic, and Temporal distortions, we have expanded our evaluation aspects to include the dimension of AIGC distortions, which addresses the increasing demand for video generation. Finally, we collect a total of 2,378 question-answer pairs and test them on 12 open-source & 5 proprietary LMMs. Our findings indicate that while LMMs have a foundational understanding of video quality, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise, with a notable discrepancy compared to human performance. Through Q-Bench-Video, we seek to catalyze community interest, stimulate further research, and unlock the untapped potential of LMMs to close the gap in video quality understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[AuroraCap: Efficient, Performant Video Detailed Captioning and a New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03051v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[PreMind: Multi-Agent Video Understanding for Advanced Indexing of Presentation-style Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00162v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, online lecture videos have become an increasingly popular resource for acquiring new knowledge. Systems capable of effectively understanding/indexing lecture videos are thus highly desirable, enabling downstream tasks like question answering to help users efficiently locate specific information within videos. This work proposes PreMind, a novel multi-agent multimodal framework that leverages various large models for advanced understanding/indexing of presentation-style videos. PreMind first segments videos into slide-presentation segments using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance modern shot-detection techniques. Each segment is then analyzed to generate multimodal indexes through three key steps: (1) extracting slide visual content, (2) transcribing speech narratives, and (3) consolidating these visual and speech contents into an integrated understanding. Three innovative mechanisms are also proposed to improve performance: leveraging prior lecture knowledge to refine visual understanding, detecting/correcting speech transcription errors using a VLM, and utilizing a critic agent for dynamic iterative self-reflection in vision analysis. Compared to traditional video indexing methods, PreMind captures rich, reliable multimodal information, allowing users to search for details like abbreviations shown only on slides. Systematic evaluations on the public LPM dataset and an internal enterprise dataset are conducted to validate PreMind's effectiveness, supported by detailed analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Keyframe Sampling for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21271v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled open-world visual understanding by injecting visual input as extra tokens into large language models (LLMs) as contexts. However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of information pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[HAIC: Improving Human Action Understanding and Generation with Better Captions for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20811v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made great progress in video understanding. However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

Although this field has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, further progress and real-world applications are impeded by the absence of a standardized framework. Currently, different methods are compared under different implementation settings, evaluation protocols, etc., making it difficult to assess the real effectiveness of a specific technique. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{OpenTAD}, a unified TAD framework consolidating 16 different TAD methods and 9 standard datasets into a modular codebase. In OpenTAD, minimal effort is required to replace one module with a different design, train a feature-based TAD model in end-to-end mode, or switch between the two. OpenTAD also facilitates straightforward benchmarking across various datasets and enables fair and in-depth comparisons among different methods. With OpenTAD, we comprehensively study how innovations in different network components affect detection performance and identify the most effective design choices through extensive experiments. This study has led to a new state-of-the-art TAD method built upon existing techniques for each component. We have made our code and models available at https://github.com/sming256/OpenTAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaxInfo: A Training-Free Key-Frame Selection Method Using Maximum Volume for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03183v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) often rely on uniform frame sampling for video understanding, but this approach frequently fails to capture critical information due to frame redundancy and variations in video content. We propose MaxInfo, a training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which selects and retains the most representative frames from the input video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. It also achieves a 3.47% improvement for LLaVA-Video-72B. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we leverage the egocentric video foundation models (Ego-VFMs) based on video-language pre-training and propose a parameter-efficient adaptation for egocentric video tasks, namely Ego-VPA. It employs a local sparse approximation for each video frame/text feature using the basis prompts, and the selected basis prompts are used to synthesize video/text prompts. Since the basis prompts are shared across frames and modalities, it models context fusion and cross-modal transfer in an efficient fashion. Experiments show that Ego-VPA excels in lightweight adaptation (with only 0.84% learnable parameters), largely improving over baselines and reaching the performance of full fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[M-LLM Based Video Frame Selection for Efficient Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19680v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) show promising results in video reasoning. Popular Multi-Modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) frameworks usually apply naive uniform sampling to reduce the number of video frames that are fed into an M-LLM, particularly for long context videos. However, it could lose crucial context in certain periods of a video, so that the downstream M-LLM may not have sufficient visual information to answer a question. To attack this pain point, we propose a light-weight M-LLM -based frame selection method that adaptively select frames that are more relevant to users' queries. In order to train the proposed frame selector, we introduce two supervision signals (i) Spatial signal, where single frame importance score by prompting a M-LLM; (ii) Temporal signal, in which multiple frames selection by prompting Large Language Model (LLM) using the captions of all frame candidates. The selected frames are then digested by a frozen downstream video M-LLM for visual reasoning and question answering. Empirical results show that the proposed M-LLM video frame selector improves the performances various downstream video Large Language Model (video-LLM) across medium (ActivityNet, NExT-QA) and long (EgoSchema, LongVideoBench) context video question answering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The Segment-Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), released by Meta AI, is the current state-of-the-art architecture for end-to-end VOS. SAM 2 performs very well on both clean video data and augmented data, and completely intelligent video perception requires an understanding of how this architecture is capable of achieving such quality results. To better understand how each step within the SAM 2 architecture permits high-quality video segmentation, we pass a variety of complex video transformations through the architecture and measure the impact at each stage of the process. We observe that each progressive stage enables the filtering of complex transformation noise and the emphasis of the object of interest. Our contributions include the creation of complex transformation video datasets, an analysis of how each stage of the SAM 2 architecture interprets these transformations, and visualizations of segmented objects through each stage. By better understanding how each model structure impacts overall video understanding, VOS development can work to improve real-world applicability and performance tracking, localizing, and segmenting objects despite complex cluttered scenes and obscurations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 30 figures |

Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

| **[VILA-M3: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Medical Expert Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12915v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in computer vision, but they fall short in specialized fields like healthcare, where expert knowledge is essential. In traditional computer vision tasks, creative or approximate answers may be acceptable, but in healthcare, precision is paramount.Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are insufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet knowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. VLMs are usually trained in three stages: vision pre-training, vision-language pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied using a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast, we propose that for medical VLMs, a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary, which focuses on medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain expert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are specifically trained for certain clinical tasks, e.g. to detect tumors and classify abnormalities through segmentation and classification, which learn fine-grained features of medical data$-$features that are often too intricate for a VLM to capture effectively especially in radiology. This paper introduces a new framework, VILA-M3, for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via expert models. Through our experiments, we show an improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an average improvement of ~9% over the prior SOTA model Med-Gemini and ~6% over models trained on the specific tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in creating precise, reliable VLMs for medical applications.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), FairSense-AI uncovers subtle forms of prejudice or stereotyping that can appear in content, providing users with bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations for fairness enhancements. In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint. Through a series of case studies and applications, we demonstrate how FairSense-AI promotes responsible AI use by addressing both the social dimension of fairness and the pressing need for sustainability in large-scale AI deployments. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/FairSense-AI, https://pypi.org/project/fair-sense-ai/</p></details> |  |

An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01773v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.</p></details> |  |

Will this simplify or complicate the DIY smart home process? Additionally, what features do users want to create using these sensors? To explore this, we conducted a three-week diary-based experience prototyping study with 12 participants. Participants recorded their daily activities, used GPT to analyze the images, and manually customized and tested smart home features based on the analysis. The study revealed three key findings: (1) participants' expectations for VLM camera-based smart homes, (2) the impact of VLM camera sensor characteristics on the DIY process, and (3) users' concerns. Through the findings of this study, we propose design implications to support the DIY smart home building process with VLM camera sensors, and discuss living with intelligence.</p></details> |  |

As two extremes, VLM-based methods emphasize zero-shot and adaptive manipulation but struggle with fine-grained planning. In contrast, MP-based approaches excel in precise trajectory generalization but lack decision-making ability. To leverage the strengths of the two frameworks, we propose VL-MP, which integrates VLM with Kernelized Movement Primitives (KMP) via a low-distortion decision information transfer bridge, enabling fine-grained robotic manipulation under ambiguous situations. One key of VL-MP is the accurate representation of task decision parameters through semantic keypoints constraints, leading to more precise task parameter generation. Additionally, we introduce a local trajectory feature-enhanced KMP to support VL-MP, thereby achieving shape preservation for complex trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted in complex real-world environments validate the effectiveness of VL-MP for adaptive and fine-grained manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, a major challenge remains ensuring safe and efficient navigation in environments filled with both dynamic alive (e.g., humans) and dynamic inanimate (e.g., non-living objects) obstacles. In this paper, we propose ImpedanceGPT, a novel system that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable real-time reasoning for adaptive navigation of mini-drone swarms in complex environments. The key innovation of ImpedanceGPT lies in the integration of VLM and RAG, which provides the drones with enhanced semantic understanding of their surroundings. This enables the system to dynamically adjust impedance control parameters in response to obstacle types and environmental conditions. Our approach not only ensures safe and precise navigation but also improves coordination between drones in the swarm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The VLM-RAG framework achieved an obstacle detection and retrieval accuracy of 80 % under optimal lighting. In static environments, drones navigated dynamic inanimate obstacles at 1.4 m/s but slowed to 0.7 m/s with increased separation around humans. In dynamic environments, speed adjusted to 1.0 m/s near hard obstacles, while reducing to 0.6 m/s with higher deflection to safely avoid moving humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), applying VLMs to offer walking guidance has become popular. However, the existing methods of walking guidance are mainly based on self-curated question-answering datasets that are not publicly accessible, without a standardized benchmark for training or evaluation. Moreover, walking assistance often requires real-time streaming video analysis and the generation of concise yet informative reminders, making VLMs struggle due to excessive responses and low efficiency in inferences. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale dataset dedicated to walking assistance, comprising 12,000 video-annotation pairs, to provide a unified benchmark for training and evaluating systems to help visually-impaired individuals walk. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code are available at https://walkvlm2024.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Current datasets fall short in scale, realism and do not capture the multimodal nature of OR scenes, limiting progress in OR modeling. To this end, we introduce MM-OR, a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal OR dataset, and the first dataset to enable multimodal scene graph generation. MM-OR captures comprehensive OR scenes containing RGB-D data, detail views, audio, speech transcripts, robotic logs, and tracking data and is annotated with panoptic segmentations, semantic scene graphs, and downstream task labels. Further, we propose MM2SG, the first multimodal large vision-language model for scene graph generation, and through extensive experiments, demonstrate its ability to effectively leverage multimodal inputs.

| **[InstaFace: Identity-Preserving Facial Editing with Single Image Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20577v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial appearance editing is crucial for digital avatars, AR/VR, and personalized content creation, driving realistic user experiences. However, preserving identity with generative models is challenging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. Traditional methods often require multiple images and still struggle with unnatural face shifts, inconsistent hair alignment, or excessive smoothing effects. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework, InstaFace, to generate realistic images while preserving identity using only a single image. Central to InstaFace, we introduce an efficient guidance network that harnesses 3D perspectives by integrating multiple 3DMM-based conditionals without introducing additional trainable parameters. Moreover, to ensure maximum identity retention as well as preservation of background, hair, and other contextual features like accessories, we introduce a novel module that utilizes feature embeddings from a facial recognition model and a pre-trained vision-language model. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of identity preservation, photorealism, and effective control of pose, expression, and lighting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Model IP Protection via Prompt-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02393v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) have seen remarkable success in visual recognition, highlighting the increasing need to safeguard the intellectual property (IP) of well-trained models. Effective IP protection extends beyond ensuring authorized usage; it also necessitates restricting model deployment to authorized data domains, particularly when the model is fine-tuned for specific target domains. However, current IP protection methods often rely solely on the visual backbone, which may lack sufficient semantic richness. To bridge this gap, we introduce IP-CLIP, a lightweight IP protection strategy tailored to CLIP, employing a prompt-based learning approach. By leveraging the frozen visual backbone of CLIP, we extract both image style and content information, incorporating them into the learning of IP prompt. This strategy acts as a robust barrier, effectively preventing the unauthorized transfer of features from authorized domains to unauthorized ones. Additionally, we propose a style-enhancement branch that constructs feature banks for both authorized and unauthorized domains. This branch integrates self-enhanced and cross-domain features, further strengthening IP-CLIP's capability to block features from unauthorized domains. Finally, we present new three metrics designed to better balance the performance degradation of authorized and unauthorized domains. Comprehensive experiments in various scenarios demonstrate its promising potential for application in IP protection tasks for VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |

This paper introduces DART-LLM, a novel framework that employs Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies, enabling the decomposition of natural language instructions into well-coordinated subtasks for multi-robot execution. DART-LLM comprises four key components: a Question-Answering (QA) LLM module for dependency-aware task decomposition, a Breakdown Function module for robot assignment, an Actuation module for execution, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detector for environmental perception, achieving end-to-end task execution. Experimental results across three task complexity levels demonstrate that DART-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming the baseline across all evaluation metrics. Among the tested models, DeepSeek-r1-671B achieves the highest success rate, whereas Llama-3.1-8B exhibits superior response time reliability. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit dependency modeling notably enhances the performance of smaller models, facilitating efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

| **[Are Large Vision Language Models Good Game Players?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02358v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding and reasoning about both visual and textual information. However, existing evaluation methods for LVLMs, primarily based on benchmarks like Visual Question Answering and image captioning, often fail to capture the full scope of LVLMs' capabilities. These benchmarks are limited by issues such as inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of focus on multi-turn reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose \method{}, a game-based evaluation framework designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. \method{} uses a set of games to evaluate LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, with each target task designed to assess specific abilities, including visual perception, reasoning, decision-making, etc. Based on this framework, we conduct extensive experiments that explore the limitations of current LVLMs, such as handling long structured outputs and perceiving detailed and dense elements.

We examine how the demographic composition of demonstration examples affects VLM performance in two medical imaging tasks: skin lesion malignancy prediction and pneumothorax detection from chest radiographs. Our analysis reveals that ICL influences model predictions through multiple mechanisms: (1) ICL allows VLMs to learn subgroup-specific disease base rates from prompts and (2) ICL leads VLMs to make predictions that perform differently across demographic groups, even after controlling for subgroup-specific disease base rates. Our empirical results inform best-practices for prompting current VLMs (specifically examining demographic subgroup performance, and matching base rates of labels to target distribution at a bulk level and within subgroups), while also suggesting next steps for improving our theoretical understanding of these models.</p></details> |  |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[Locality Alignment Improves Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11087v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this with a vision backbone that effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability - pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at patch-level semantic segmentation, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure benefits VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-Ready</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18711v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Guided Visual Perception Disentanglement for Image Quality Assessment and Conditional Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02206v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated excellent zero-shot capability across semantic recognition tasks, mainly attributed to the training on a large-scale I&1T (one Image with one Text) dataset. This kind of multimodal representations often blend semantic and perceptual elements, placing a particular emphasis on semantics. However, this could be problematic for popular tasks like image quality assessment (IQA) and conditional image generation (CIG), which typically need to have fine control on perceptual and semantic features. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a new multimodal disentangled representation learning framework, which leverages disentangled text to guide image disentanglement. To this end, we first build an I&2T (one Image with a perceptual Text and a semantic Text) dataset, which consists of disentangled perceptual and semantic text descriptions for an image. Then, the disentangled text descriptions are utilized as supervisory signals to disentangle pure perceptual representations from CLIP's original `coarse' feature space, dubbed DeCLIP. Finally, the decoupled feature representations are used for both image quality assessment (technical quality and aesthetic quality) and conditional image generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method on the two popular tasks. The dataset, code, and model will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-driven Transferable Adversarial Attack on Person Re-Identification with Attribute-aware Textual Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19697v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-id) models are vital in security surveillance systems, requiring transferable adversarial attacks to explore the vulnerabilities of them. Recently, vision-language models (VLM) based attacks have shown superior transferability by attacking generalized image and textual features of VLM, but they lack comprehensive feature disruption due to the overemphasis on discriminative semantics in integral representation. In this paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings, trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that AP-Attack achieves state-of-the-art transferability, significantly outperforming previous methods by 22.9% on mean Drop Rate in cross-model&dataset attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \emph{``blind faith in text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p></details> | Preprint |

A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR): A New Benchmark for Multimodal Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16033v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p></details> |  |

Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture. Our evaluation demonstrates that the open models trained on recipe data outperform GPT-4o, the current state-of-the-art model, in ingredient generation.

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |

Due to fewer social connections and cultural adaptation challenges, they face negative emotions such as loneliness and depression. While reminiscence-based interventions have been used to improve older adults' psychological well-being, challenges such as the lack of tangible materials and limited social resources constrain the feasibility of traditional reminiscence approaches for older drifters. To address this challenge, we designed RemiHaven, a personalized reminiscence support tool based on a two-phase formative study. It integrates "In-Town" and "Out-of-Town" peer agents to enhance personalization, engagement, and emotional resonance in the reminiscence process, powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our evaluations show RemiHaven's strengths in supporting reminiscence while identifying potential challenges. We conclude by offering insights for the future design of reminiscence support tools for older migrants.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations.

| **[Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15998v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle, HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/NVEagle</p></details> |

Traditional methods using document parsers for retrieval-augmented generation suffer from performance and efficiency limitations, while directly presenting all pages to MLLMs leads to inefficiencies, especially with lengthy ones. In this work, we present a novel framework named **S**elf-**V**isual **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration (SV-RAG), which can broaden horizons of any MLLM to support long-document understanding. We demonstrate that **MLLMs themselves can be an effective multimodal retriever** to fetch relevant pages and then answer user questions based on these pages. SV-RAG is implemented with two specific MLLM adapters, one for evidence page retrieval and the other for question answering. Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of SV-RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, their capabilities in interpreting fundus images, a critical skill for ophthalmology, remain under-evaluated. Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained task divisions and fail to provide modular analysis of its two key modules, i.e., large language model (LLM) and vision encoder (VE). This paper introduces FunBench, a novel visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' fundus reading skills. FunBench features a hierarchical task organization across four levels (modality perception, anatomy perception, lesion analysis, and disease diagnosis). It also offers three targeted evaluation modes: linear-probe based VE evaluation, knowledge-prompted LLM evaluation, and holistic evaluation. Experiments on nine open-source MLLMs plus GPT-4o reveal significant deficiencies in fundus reading skills, particularly in basic tasks such as laterality recognition. The results highlight the limitations of current MLLMs and emphasize the need for domain-specific training and improved LLMs and VEs.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[MobA: Multifaceted Memory-Enhanced Adaptive Planning for Efficient Mobile Task Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13757v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents face significant challenges in handling complex GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions on devices. These challenges arise from the dynamic and structured nature of GUI environments, which integrate text, images, and spatial relationships, as well as the variability in action spaces across different pages and tasks. To address these limitations, we propose MobA, a novel MLLM-based mobile assistant system. MobA introduces an adaptive planning module that incorporates a reflection mechanism for error recovery and dynamically adjusts plans to align with the real environment contexts and action module's execution capacity. Additionally, a multifaceted memory module provides comprehensive memory support to enhance adaptability and efficiency. We also present MobBench, a dataset designed for complex mobile interactions. Experimental results on MobBench and AndroidArena demonstrate MobA's ability to handle dynamic GUI environments and perform complex mobile task.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Demo Track</p></details> |

However, the rapid pace of knowledge updates in the real world makes offline training of MLLMs costly, and when faced with non-stationary data streams, MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during learning. In this paper, we propose an MLLMs-based dual momentum Mixture-of-Experts (CL-MoE) framework for continual visual question answering (VQA). We integrate MLLMs with continual learning to utilize the rich commonsense knowledge in LLMs. We introduce a Dual-Router MoE (RMoE) strategy to select the global and local experts using task-level and instance-level routers, to robustly assign weights to the experts most appropriate for the task. Then, we design a dynamic Momentum MoE (MMoE) to update the parameters of experts dynamically based on the relationships between the experts and tasks/instances, so that the model can absorb new knowledge while maintaining existing knowledge. The extensive experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 VQA tasks, proving the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 figures,accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control, resulting in suboptimal and sometimes unsafe driving behaviors. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can process both visual and textual data, presents an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning tasks within a single framework. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a novel framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving systems by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce the Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss function, designed to improve the accuracy of low-level control signal predictions when numerical values are represented as text. Second, to ensure safe autonomous driving by explicitly integrating precise safety knowledge into the MLLM, we develop a reasoning component for SafeAuto. This component translates driving safety regulations into first-order logic rules (e.g., "red light => stop") and incorporates these rules into a probabilistic graphical model, such as a Markov Logic Network (MLN). The MLN is trained to verify the predicted next actions using environmental attributes identified by attribute recognition models (e.g., detecting a red light) to form the predicates. Additionally, we construct a Multimodal RAG model that leverages video data, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn more effectively from past similar driving experiences. By integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets. This advancement enables more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving systems that learn from experience, obey traffic laws, and perform precise control actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Keyframe Sampling for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21271v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled open-world visual understanding by injecting visual input as extra tokens into large language models (LLMs) as contexts. However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of information pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[RoboBrain: A Unified Brain Model for Robotic Manipulation from Abstract to Concrete](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21257v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various multimodal contexts. However, their application in robotic scenarios, particularly for long-horizon manipulation tasks, reveals significant limitations. These limitations arise from the current MLLMs lacking three essential robotic brain capabilities: Planning Capability, which involves decomposing complex manipulation instructions into manageable sub-tasks; Affordance Perception, the ability to recognize and interpret the affordances of interactive objects; and Trajectory Prediction, the foresight to anticipate the complete manipulation trajectory necessary for successful execution. To enhance the robotic brain's core capabilities from abstract to concrete, we introduce ShareRobot, a high-quality heterogeneous dataset that labels multi-dimensional information such as task planning, object affordance, and end-effector trajectory. ShareRobot's diversity and accuracy have been meticulously refined by three human annotators. Building on this dataset, we developed RoboBrain, an MLLM-based model that combines robotic and general multi-modal data, utilizes a multi-stage training strategy, and incorporates long videos and high-resolution images to improve its robotic manipulation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance across various robotic tasks, highlighting its potential to advance robotic brain capabilities.</p></details> |  |
