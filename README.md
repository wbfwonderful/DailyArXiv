| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[RefineVAD: Semantic-Guided Feature Recalibration for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13204v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Coherence for Configurable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07328v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) relies on technologies in the field of signal processing. Since the anomaly is quite ambiguous and unbounded, different detection demands may often be raised even in one scenario. Thus, we propose to design the configurable VAD with flexible solutions targeting to solve the issue that previous methods have to train their models from scratch and waste resources when detection demands even change slightly. Moreover, we also design a dataset with good compatibility to evaluate the VAD performance when changes happen in detection demands. Besides, videos contain important information regarding continuous changes in the object's appearance and motion. Thus, we also propose a module to establish the multi-scale spatial-temporal coherence, which improves the accuracy and has the ability to dynamically adjust and accurately capture spatial-temporal normal patterns. Experiments show that our method not only models coherence effectively but also has better configurable ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeadHunt-VAD: Hunting Robust Anomaly-Sensitive Heads in MLLM for Tuning-Free Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17601v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo Anomalies Are All You Need: Diffusion-Based Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06845v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying video anomaly detection in practice is hampered by the scarcity and collection cost of real abnormal footage. We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CADE: Continual Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06840v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has long been studied as a crucial problem in public security and crime prevention. In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the "incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v4)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Semantics-Aware Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods face two critical challenges: (1) Strong generalization blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal patterns. Although existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue using memory modules, their rigid prototype-matching process limits adaptability to diverse scenarios; (2) Relying solely on low-level appearance and motion cues makes it difficult to perceive high-level semantic anomalies in complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose SIB-VAD, a novel framework based on adaptive information bottleneck filtering and semantic-aware enhancement. We propose the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) to replace traditional memory modules. It compresses normal features directly into a low-dimensional manifold based on the information bottleneck principle and uses an adaptive routing mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable normal bottleneck subspace. Trained only on normal data, SFFMs only learn normal low-dimensional manifolds, while abnormal features deviate and are effectively filtered. Unlike memory modules, SFFM directly removes abnormal information and adaptively handles scene variations. To improve semantic awareness, we further design a multimodal prediction framework that jointly models appearance, motion, and semantics. Through multimodal consistency constraints and joint error computation, it achieves more robust VAD performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our feature filtering paradigm based on semantics-aware information bottleneck.

| **[Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Sparse Reasoning is Enough: Biological-Inspired Framework for Video Anomaly Detection with Large Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17094v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Time in Static Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12321v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

| **[Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |
| **[M2S2L: Mamba-based Multi-Scale Spatial-temporal Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05564v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.</p></details> | IEEE VCIP 2025 |
| **[A Unified Reasoning Framework for Holistic Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00962v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training. Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding, yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection, localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in a fully zero-shot manner.

| **[TRACES: Temporal Recall with Contextual Embeddings for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00580v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context, which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve 90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</p></details> |  |

| **[GLM-4.5V and GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006v6)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, GLM-4.5V, and GLM-4.6V, a family of vision-language models (VLMs) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. We further introduce the GLM-4.6V series, open-source multimodal models with native tool use and a 128K context window. A brief overview is available at https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.6v. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation via Dual-Modal Causal Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24323v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Taming Hallucinations: Boosting MLLMs' Video Understanding via Counterfactual Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24271v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach.

However, while existing models can understand images and videos at a holistic level, they still struggle with instance-level understanding that requires a more fine-grained comprehension and alignment. Instance-level understanding is crucial for LMMs, as it focuses on the specific elements that we are most interested in. Excitingly, existing works find that the SOTA LMMs exhibit strong instance understanding capabilities when provided with explicit visual cues. Motivated by this, we proposed Inst-IT, a solution to enhance LMMs in Instance understanding via explicit visual prompt Instruction Tuning for instance guidance. Inst-IT consists of a benchmark to diagnose multimodal instance-level understanding, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a continuous instruction-tuning training paradigm to effectively enhance spatial-temporal instance understanding capabilities of existing LMMs. Experimental results show that, enhanced by Inst-IT, our models not only achieve outstanding performance on Inst-IT Bench and other instance understanding benchmarks, but also demonstrate significant improvements across various generic image and video understanding benchmarks. This highlights that our method not only boosts instance-level understanding but also strengthens the overall capabilities of generic image and video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.</p></details> |  |

We propose MaxInfo, the first training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which is available in Fast and Slow versions and a Chunk-based version that selects and retains the most representative frames from a video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. Moreover, MaxInfo boosts LongVideoBench performance by 3.47% on LLaVA-Video-72B and 3.44% on MiniCPM4.5. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training and very lower latency, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website:https://kd-tao.github.io/OmniAgent/</p></details> |

To bridge this cognitive gap, we propose a novel framework that synergistically fuses a powerful Vision Foundation Model (VFM) for deep visual perception with a Large Language Model (LLM) serving as a knowledge-driven reasoning core. Our key technical innovation is a sophisticated fusion module, inspired by the Q-Former architecture, which distills complex spatiotemporal and object-centric visual features into a concise, language-aligned representation. This enables the LLM to effectively ground its inferential processes in direct visual evidence. The model is trained via a two-stage strategy, beginning with large-scale alignment pre-training on video-text data, followed by targeted instruction fine-tuning on a curated dataset designed to elicit advanced reasoning and prediction skills. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks. Notably, it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen reasoning tasks, and our in-depth ablation studies validate the critical contribution of each architectural component. This work pushes the boundary of machine perception from simple recognition towards genuine cognitive understanding, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in robotics, human-computer interaction, and beyond.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[VideoZoomer: Reinforcement-Learned Temporal Focusing for Long Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22315v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.</p></details> |  |

Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.</p></details> |  |

While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.</p></details> | Under Review |

Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChainReaction: Causal Chain-Guided Reasoning for Modular and Explainable Causal-Why Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular paradigm that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that derives answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating accurate causal chains from existing datasets. We construct human verified causal chains for 46K samples. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

Sports officiating is a representative case, where fast, subtle interactions must be judged via symbolic rules. We present FERA (FEncing Referee Assistant), a pose-based framework that turns broadcast foil fencing video into action tokens and rule-grounded explanations. From monocular footage, FERA extracts 2D poses, converts them into a 101-dimensional kinematic representation, and applies an encoder-only transformer (FERA-MDT) to recognize per-fencer footwork, blade actions, and blade-line position. To obtain a consistent single-fencer representation for both athletes, FERA processes each clip and a horizontally flipped copy, yielding time-aligned left/right predictions without requiring a multi-person pose pipeline. A dynamic temporal windowing scheme enables inference on untrimmed pose tracks. These structured predictions serve as tokens for a language model (FERA-LM) that applies simplified right-of-way rules to generate textual decisions. On 1,734 clips (2,386 annotated actions), FERA-MDT achieves a macro-F1 of 0.549 under 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming BiLSTM and TCN baselines. Combined with FERA-LM, the full pipeline recovers referee priority with 77.7% accuracy on 969 exchanges. FERA provides a case-study benchmark for pose-based semantic grounding in a two-person sport and illustrates a general pipeline for connecting video understanding with rule-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated Methodology and polished sections</p></details> |
| **[Proprioception Enhances Vision Language Model in Generating Captions and Subtask Segmentations for Robot Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20876v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are limited to temporal localization of when the object is in its initial state (e.g., cheese block) versus when it has completed a state change (e.g., grated cheese), offering no insight into where the change is unfolding. We propose to deepen the problem by introducing the spatially-progressing object state change segmentation task. The goal is to segment at the pixel-level those regions of an object that are actionable and those that are transformed. We show that state-of-the-art VLMs and video segmentation methods struggle at this task, underscoring its difficulty and novelty. As an initial baseline, we design a VLM-based pseudo-labeling approach, state-change dynamics constraints, and a novel WhereToChange benchmark built on in-the-wild Internet videos. Experiments on two datasets validate both the challenge of the new task as well as the promise of our model for localizing exactly where and how fast objects are changing in video. We further demonstrate useful implications for tracking activity progress to benefit robotic agents. Overall, our work positions spatial OSC segmentation as a new frontier task for video understanding: one that challenges current SOTA methods and invites the community to build more robust, state-change-sensitive representations.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension.

Built on PE, PE-AV makes several key contributions to extend representations to audio, and natively support joint embeddings across audio-video, audio-text, and video-text modalities. PE-AV's unified cross-modal embeddings enable novel tasks such as speech retrieval, and set a new state of the art across standard audio and video benchmarks. We unlock this by building a strong audiovisual data engine that synthesizes high-quality captions for O(100M) audio-video pairs, enabling large-scale supervision consistent across modalities. Our audio data includes speech, music, and general sound effects-avoiding single-domain limitations common in prior work. We exploit ten pairwise contrastive objectives, showing that scaling cross-modality and caption-type pairs strengthens alignment and improves zero-shot performance. We further develop PE-A-Frame by fine-tuning PE-AV with frame-level contrastive objectives, enabling fine-grained audio-frame-to-text alignment for tasks such as sound event detection.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we investigate how to efficiently utilize class text information to mitigate distribution drifts encountered by VLMs during inference. In particular, we propose generating pseudo-labels for the noisy test-time samples by aligning visual embeddings with reliable, text-based semantic anchors. Specifically, to maintain the regular structure of the dataset properly, we formulate the problem as a batch-wise label assignment, which is efficiently solved using Optimal Transport. Our method, Semantic Anchor Transport (SAT), utilizes such pseudo-labels as supervisory signals for test-time adaptation, yielding a principled cross-modal alignment solution. Moreover, SAT further leverages heterogeneous textual clues, with a multi-template distillation approach that replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of SAT, achieving consistent performance gains over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional figures to communicate the algorithm</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to explore the potential of MLLMs for audio deepfake detection. Combining audio inputs with a range of text prompts as queries to find out the viability of MLLMs to learn robust representations across modalities for audio deepfake detection. Therefore, we attempt to explore text-aware and context-rich, question-answer based prompts with binary decisions. We hypothesise that such a feature-guided reasoning will help in facilitating deeper multimodal understanding and enable robust feature learning for audio deepfake detection. We evaluate the performance of two MLLMs, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and SALMONN, in two evaluation modes: (a) zero-shot and (b) fine-tuned. Our experiments demonstrate that combining audio with a multi-prompt approach could be a viable way forward for audio deepfake detection. Our experiments show that the models perform poorly without task-specific training and struggle to generalise to out-of-domain data. However, they achieve good performance on in-domain data with minimal supervision, indicating promising potential for audio deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCB 2025</p></details> |

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, they often fall short in other critical quality dimensions, such as robustness, calibration, or fairness. While existing studies have focused on a subset of these quality dimensions, none have explored a more general form of "well-behavedness" of DNNs. With this work, we address this gap by simultaneously studying nine different quality dimensions for image classification. Through a large-scale study, we provide a bird's-eye view by analyzing 326 backbone models and how different training paradigms and model architectures affect these quality dimensions. We reveal various new insights such that (i) vision-language models exhibit high class balance on ImageNet-1k classification and strong robustness against domain changes; (ii) training models initialized with weights obtained through self-supervised learning is an effective strategy to improve most considered quality dimensions; and (iii) the training dataset size is a major driver for most of the quality dimensions. We conclude our study by introducing the QUBA score (Quality Understanding Beyond Accuracy), a novel metric that ranks models across multiple dimensions of quality, enabling tailored recommendations based on specific user needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR (12/2025) | OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=E7HDtLCoT6 | Project page: https://visinf.github.io/beyond-accuracy/</p></details> |
| **[RoboReward: General-Purpose Vision-Language Reward Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00675v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement. In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a \emph{negative examples data augmentation} pipeline that generates calibrated \emph{negatives} and \emph{near-misses} via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRoPS: A Training-Free Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00659v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use. Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2026</p></details> |

However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

| **[CPPO: Contrastive Perception for Vision Language Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00501v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CPPO, a Contrastive Perception Policy Optimization method for finetuning vision-language models (VLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Embodied VLM Reasoning with Robotic Action via Autoregressive Discretized Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24125v2)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robotic systems operating in open-world environments must achieve both broad generalization and high-precision action execution, a combination that remains challenging for existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks. Together, ERIQ and FACT provide a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming the reasoning-precision trade-off, advancing robust, general-purpose robotic manipulation.

However, existing approaches often rely on synthetic reasoning annotations or external image retrieval, which can limit interpretability and generalizability. In this paper, we present Geo-R, a retrieval-free framework that uncovers structured reasoning paths from existing ground-truth coordinates and optimizes geolocation accuracy via reinforcement learning. We propose the Chain of Region, a rule-based hierarchical reasoning paradigm that generates precise, interpretable supervision by mapping GPS coordinates to geographic entities (e.g., country, province, city) without relying on model-generated or synthetic labels. Building on this, we introduce a lightweight reinforcement learning strategy with coordinate-aligned rewards based on Haversine distance, enabling the model to refine predictions through spatially meaningful feedback. Our approach bridges structured geographic reasoning with direct spatial supervision, yielding improved localization accuracy, stronger generalization, and more transparent inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of Geo-R, establishing a new retrieval-free paradigm for scalable and interpretable image geolocalization. To facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, both the model and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figures |

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks. We open-source both GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and GLM-4.5V. We further introduce the GLM-4.6V series, open-source multimodal models with native tool use and a 128K context window.

| **[FaithSCAN: Model-Driven Single-Pass Hallucination Detection for Faithful Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00269v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, these models suffer from object hallucination. In this work, we study object hallucination primarily in a discriminative, retrieval-style evaluation setting (OHD-Caps), rather than in free-form caption generation. This study revisits the previous claim that the cause of such hallucinations lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis implies that the capacity of the vision encoder is not necessarily a major limiting factor in detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of 39.6% without additional training. We further demonstrate that F-CLIPScore-based data filtering reduces object hallucination in LVLM (4.9% in POPE accuracy after alignment pretraining).

It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

However, limited work exists on studying the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- a critical factor that directly impacts public transportation safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark for large vision-language models in autonomous driving (DriveVLMs), considering diverse perspectives -- including trustfulness, safety, robustness, privacy, and fairness. We constructed the largest visual question-answering dataset for investigating trustworthiness issues in driving scenarios, comprising over 10k unique scenes and 18k queries. We evaluated six publicly available VLMs, spanning from generalist to specialist, from open-source to commercial models. Our exhaustive evaluations have unveiled previously undiscovered vulnerabilities of DriveVLMs to trustworthiness threats. Specifically, we found that the general VLMs like LLaVA-v1.6 and GPT-4o-mini surprisingly outperform specialized models fine-tuned for driving in terms of overall trustworthiness. DriveVLMs like DriveLM-Agent are particularly vulnerable to disclosing sensitive information. Additionally, both generalist and specialist VLMs remain susceptible to adversarial attacks and struggle to ensure unbiased decision-making across diverse environments and populations. Our findings call for immediate and decisive action to address the trustworthiness of DriveVLMs -- an issue of critical importance to public safety and the welfare of all citizens relying on autonomous transportation systems.

We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to explore the potential of MLLMs for audio deepfake detection. Combining audio inputs with a range of text prompts as queries to find out the viability of MLLMs to learn robust representations across modalities for audio deepfake detection. Therefore, we attempt to explore text-aware and context-rich, question-answer based prompts with binary decisions. We hypothesise that such a feature-guided reasoning will help in facilitating deeper multimodal understanding and enable robust feature learning for audio deepfake detection. We evaluate the performance of two MLLMs, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct and SALMONN, in two evaluation modes: (a) zero-shot and (b) fine-tuned. Our experiments demonstrate that combining audio with a multi-prompt approach could be a viable way forward for audio deepfake detection. Our experiments show that the models perform poorly without task-specific training and struggle to generalise to out-of-domain data. However, they achieve good performance on in-domain data with minimal supervision, indicating promising potential for audio deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCB 2025</p></details> |

We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on direct image captioning or classification of realistic images, VisualQuest comprises 3,551 non-photographic, stylized images spanning four categories: Public Figures, Popular Culture, Linguistic Expressions, and Literary Works. Each image is paired with targeted questions to probe complex reasoning. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that only Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-4o achieve strong overall performance, while 3.7 percent of the images remain unrecognized by any model, underscoring persistent challenges in multimodal understanding. Fine-grained analysis shows that Gemini excels at recognizing stylized public figures, whereas GPT-4o leads in linguistic reasoning tasks such as visual puns and emoji combinations. VisualQuest provides a comprehensive and challenging resource for advancing research in abstract visual reasoning and highlights key areas for future model improvement.

Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

| **[From Sight to Insight: Improving Visual Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00215v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers. However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7. To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-VL-7B achieve 5.56% improvements over the base model, with consistent gains across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-26 Main Track</p></details> |
| **[VLN-MME: Diagnosing MLLMs as Language-guided Visual Navigation agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24851v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zoomer: Adaptive Image Focus Optimization for Black-box MLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00742v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o, Gemini Pro, and Claude 3.5 have enabled unified reasoning over text and visual inputs, yet they often hallucinate in real world scenarios especially when small objects or fine spatial context are involved. We pinpoint two core causes of this failure: the absence of region-adaptive attention and inflexible token budgets that force uniform downsampling, leading to critical information loss. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Zoomer, a visual prompting framework that delivers token-efficient, detail-preserving image representations for black-box MLLMs. Zoomer integrates (1) a prompt-aware emphasis module to highlight semantically relevant regions, (2) a spatial-preserving orchestration schema to maintain object relationships, and (3) a budget-aware strategy to adaptively allocate tokens between global context and local details. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks and three commercial MLLMs demonstrate that Zoomer boosts accuracy by up to 27% while cutting image token usage by up to 67%. Our approach establishes a principled methodology for robust, resource-aware multimodal understanding in settings where model internals are inaccessible.</p></details> | TMLR accepted |

While traditional unimodal methods have made progress, the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) brings new challenges in Multimodal Continual Learning (MCL), where models are expected to address both catastrophic forgetting and cross-modal coordination. To advance research in this area, we present MCITlib, a comprehensive library for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning. MCITlib currently implements 8 representative algorithms and conducts evaluations on 3 benchmarks under 2 backbone models. The library will be continuously updated to support future developments in MCL. The codebase is released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[TIM-PRM: Verifying multimodal reasoning with Tool-Integrated PRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22998v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.</p></details> | 12 pages |

As model merging becomes increasingly prevalent across various fields, it is crucial to understand the available model merging techniques comprehensively. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding a systematic and thorough review of these techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of model merging methods and theories, their applications in various domains and settings, and future research directions. Specifically, we first propose a new taxonomic approach that exhaustively discusses existing model merging methods. Secondly, we discuss the application of model merging techniques in large language models, multimodal large language models, and more than ten machine learning subfields, including continual learning, multi-task learning, few-shot learning, etc. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of model merging and discuss future research directions.

| **[Do Language Models Associate Sound with Meaning? A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045v4)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 27 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Cross-Modal Representations with MLLM Priors via Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06970v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MM-SpuBench: Towards Better Understanding of Spurious Biases in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17126v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spurious bias, a tendency to exploit spurious correlations between superficial input attributes and prediction targets, has revealed a severe robustness pitfall in classical machine learning problems. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which leverage pretrained vision and language models, have recently demonstrated strong capability in joint vision-language understanding. However, both the presence and severity of spurious biases in MLLMs remain poorly understood. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the spurious biases in the multimodal setting and uncovering the specific inference-time data patterns that can manifest this problem. To support this analysis, we introduce MM-SpuBench, a comprehensive, human-verified benchmark dataset consisting of image-class pairs annotated with core and spurious attributes, grounded in our taxonomy of nine distinct types of spurious correlations. The benchmark is constructed using human-interpretable attribute information to capture a wide range of spurious patterns reflective of real-world knowledge. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs with both standard accuracy and the proposed Conditional Generation Likelihood Advantage (CGLA). Our findings highlight the persistence of reliance on spurious correlations and the difficulty of mitigation on our benchmark. We hope this work can inspire new technical strides to mitigate these biases. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmbench/MM-SpuBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 (Dataset and Benchmark Track)</p></details> |
| **[RxnBench: A Multimodal Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models on Chemical Reaction Understanding from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23565v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Hallucinations: Boosting MLLMs' Video Understanding via Counterfactual Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24271v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[CVBench: Benchmarking Cross-Video Synergies for Complex Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19542v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their capability for spatiotemporal pattern reasoning across multiple videos remains a critical gap in pattern recognition research. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first diagnostic benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to analyze and integrate spatiotemporal patterns from dynamic visual streams. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 63.5% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91.3% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLMs architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for advancing pattern recognition methodologies in multi-video scenarios, providing architectural insights for next-generation models. The data and evaluation code are available at: https://github.com/Hokhim2/CVBench.</p></details> |  |
