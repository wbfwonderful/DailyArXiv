| **[A Unified Reasoning Framework for Holistic Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00962v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training. Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding, yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection, localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in a fully zero-shot manner.

| **[TRACES: Temporal Recall with Contextual Embeddings for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00580v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context, which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve 90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection under Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask may be considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly scores. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detector), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions under weak supervision with two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate LaGoVAD's SOTA performance. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/Kamino666/LaGoVAD-PreVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/PANDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTFL: Multi-Timescale Feature Learning for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05900v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of anomaly events is relevant for public safety and requires a combination of fine-grained motion information and contextual events at variable time-scales. To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameShield: Adversarially Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21532v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.</p></details> | 28 page, 5 figures |
| **[MoniTor: Exploiting Large Language Models with Instruction for Online Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21449v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame. Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available at https://github.com/YsTvT/MoniTor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. The first two authors hold equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cerberus: Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection via Cascaded Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16290v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a 151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time video analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made prematurely.

| **[Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

| **[VidText: Towards Comprehensive Evaluation for Video Text Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22810v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual texts embedded in videos carry rich semantic information, which is crucial for both holistic video understanding and fine-grained reasoning about local human actions. However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18079v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery (DVD) agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Unlike previous video agents that rely on predefined workflows applied uniformly across different queries, our approach emphasizes the autonomous and adaptive nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools to orchestrate adaptive workflow for different queries in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates our advantage. Our DVD agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging LVBench dataset, reaching an accuracy of 74.2%, which substantially surpasses all prior works, and further improves to 76.0% with transcripts.

Although current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fleming-VL: Towards Universal Medical Visual Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00916v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoExplorer: Think With Videos For Agentic Long-Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v6)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards.

| **[LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |
| **[FLoC: Facility Location-Based Efficient Visual Token Compression for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00141v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in long video understanding have harnessed the advanced visual-language reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), driving the evolution of video-LMMs specialized for processing extended video sequences. However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences. To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens, drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free, model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its efficiency in processing speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRoPE: Rotary Position Embedding for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11664v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has shown strong performance in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), but extending it to video remains a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal structure of video frames. Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks.

Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVA: Towards Agentic Video Analytics with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254v5)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava.

Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at: https://alirasekh.github.io/STAVEQ2/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05034v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding.

Real visual understanding, especially of physics and common sense, is essential for AI systems that interact with the physical world. Current evaluations mostly use real-world videos similar to training data, so high benchmark scores may not reflect real reasoning ability. To address this, we propose negative-control tests using videos that depict physically impossible or logically inconsistent events. We introduce VideoHallu, a synthetic dataset of physics- and commonsense-violating scenes generated with Veo2, Sora, and Kling. It includes expert-annotated question-answer pairs across four categories of violations. Tests of leading VLMs (Qwen-2.5-VL, Video-R1, VideoChat-R1) show that, despite strong results on benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU, they often miss these violations, exposing gaps in visual reasoning. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on VideoHallu improves recognition of such violations without reducing standard benchmark performance.

However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.17647</p></details> |

| **[XR-1: Towards Versatile Vision-Language-Action Models via Learning Unified Vision-Motion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02776v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

| **[Prompt to Restore, Restore to Prompt: Cyclic Prompting for Universal Adverse Weather Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09013v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal adverse weather removal (UAWR) seeks to address various weather degradations within a unified framework. Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIP against Agent: Malicious Image Patches Hijacking Multimodal OS Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10809v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Flat to Hierarchical: Extracting Sparse Representations with Matching Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03093v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help identify said features and gain further insights into neural network representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest. Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

This paper addresses the critical yet unexplored inferential privacy threat, the risk of inferring sensitive personal attributes over the data. To address this gap, we crowdsourced a dataset of 508 everyday personal videos from 58 individuals. We then conducted a benchmark study evaluating VLM inference capabilities against human performance. Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1) VLMs possess superhuman inferential capabilities, significantly outperforming human evaluators, leveraging a shift from object recognition to behavioral inference from temporal streams. (2) Inferential risk is strongly correlated with factors such as video characteristics and prompting strategies. (3) VLM-driven explanation towards the inference is unreliable, as we revealed a disconnect between the model-generated explanations and evidential impact, identifying ubiquitous objects as misleading confounders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18065v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

| **[CoCoVa: Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought for Latent Space Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02360v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks. The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded Vision-Language Interpreter for Integrated Task and Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03270v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in vision-language models have accelerated the development of language-guided robot planners, their black-box nature often lacks safety guarantees and interpretability crucial for real-world deployment. Conversely, classical symbolic planners offer rigorous safety verification but require significant expert knowledge for setup. To bridge the current gap, this paper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling verifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP comprises three main components: (1) a Vision-Language Interpreter (ViLaIn) adapted from previous work that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem specifications, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds these specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and geometric constraint reasoning, and (3) a corrective planning (CP) module which receives concrete feedback on failed solution attempts and feed them with constraints back to ViLaIn to refine the specification. We design challenging manipulation tasks in a cooking domain and evaluate our framework. Experimental results demonstrate that ViLaIn-TAMP outperforms a VLM-as-a-planner baseline by 18% in mean success rate, and that adding the CP module boosts mean success rate by 32%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://omron-sinicx.github.io/ViLaIn-TAMP/</p></details> |
| **[LACY: A Vision-Language Model-based Language-Action Cycle for Self-Improving Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02239v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However, this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

| **[Dynamic Routing Between Experts: A Data-Efficient Approach to Continual Learning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01831v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting when sequentially fine-tuned on new tasks, degrading performance on previously learned foundational and task-specific capabilities. While multi-task learning can mitigate forgetting, it requires simultaneous access to all datasets and imposes computational overhead that scales linearly with the number of tasks. In this work, we introduce a routing-based approach that enables the integration of new tasks while preserving the foundational knowledge acquired during pretraining. We evaluate our method using InternVL-2 models (2B and 8B parameters) and demonstrate that routing preserves the model's foundational capabilities by maintaining performance on general-purpose benchmarks such as ChartQA, MMBench, and DocVQA, while simultaneously improving accuracy on specialized tasks. Importantly, our approach achieves this without requiring concurrent access to data from all tasks, avoiding the significant computational and data overhead associated with traditional multi-task learning. We further conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the scalability and robustness of routing-based learning, showing that the approach is resilient to a growing number of tasks and performs particularly well when new tasks are semantically related. Finally, we show that the routing mechanism enables superior cross-modal transfer between language and vision capabilities, allowing knowledge learned in one modality to enhance performance in another capability not achieved by existing continual learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ID-Composer: Multi-Subject Video Synthesis with Hierarchical Identity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00511v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image, limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos, ID-Composer designs a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism, which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects and modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user intention, we introduce semantic understanding via pretrained vision-language model (VLM), leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex interactions between multiple subjects. Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in aligning the critical concepts like subject ID, we employ an online reinforcement learning phase to drive the overall training objective of ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and video quality.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces MetAdv, a novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines, end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments, with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla. A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM 2025 Most Popular Demo Award</p></details> |

However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.</p></details> | Need more refinement |

We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Creative AI Track</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations with Vision-Language Models and Information-Aware Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that incorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to significant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities, preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.</p></details> |  |

While visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision, reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use SciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the mechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that vision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system beyond a visual pattern.

Existing approaches use large language models (LLMs) to automate gripper-based simulation generation, but they transfer poorly to dexterous manipulation, which demands more specialized environment design. Meanwhile, dexterous manipulation tasks are inherently more difficult due to their higher degrees of freedom. Massively generating feasible and trainable dexterous hand tasks remains an open challenge. To this end, we present GenDexHand, a generative simulation pipeline that autonomously produces diverse robotic tasks and environments for dexterous manipulation. GenDexHand introduces a closed-loop refinement process that adjusts object placements and scales based on vision-language model (VLM) feedback, substantially improving the average quality of generated environments. Each task is further decomposed into sub-tasks to enable sequential reinforcement learning, reducing training time and increasing success rates. Our work provides a viable path toward scalable training of diverse dexterous hand behaviors in embodied intelligence by offering a simulation-based solution to synthetic data generation.

Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning (MAR) Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through "drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems, annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large language models, including strongest private models as well as strong open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts. However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning on MIRA.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[LLEXICORP: End-user Explainability of Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02720v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability. To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders. We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |

To address data scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA (avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion, our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework.

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | ICCV2025 Workshop |

To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. \texttt{UniWorld-V2}, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available to support further research.</p></details> |  |

However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, EMNLP25 Accepted</p></details> |
| **[InternSVG: Towards Unified SVG Tasks with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11341v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02280v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty (the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs. Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law: the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions, we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>1st p...</summary><p>1st place winner of Grounded Videoqa track at the ICCV2025 Perception Test</p></details> |
| **[DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |
| **[Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02071v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation, conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows. Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm, humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures, provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Agentic Thinking-with-Images Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01833v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3, which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic, and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks, each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally, we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[ShortV: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models by Freezing Visual Tokens in Ineffective Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00502v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to their massive size and the large number of visual tokens. In this paper, we investigate layer-wise redundancy in MLLMs by introducing a novel metric, Layer Contribution (LC), which quantifies the impact of a layer's transformations on visual and text tokens, respectively. The calculation of LC involves measuring the divergence in model output that results from removing the layer's transformations on the specified tokens. Our pilot experiment reveals that many layers of MLLMs exhibit minimal contribution during the processing of visual tokens. Motivated by this observation, we propose ShortV, a training-free method that leverages LC to identify ineffective layers, and freezes visual token updates in these layers. Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual token in approximately 60\% of the MLLM layers, thereby dramatically reducing computational costs related to updating visual tokens. For example, it achieves a 50\% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B while maintaining superior performance. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/ShortV</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICCV 2025.

| **[Actial: Activate Spatial Reasoning Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01618v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved 2D visual understanding, prompting interest in their application to complex 3D reasoning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required for robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key requirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset, consisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and corresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline MLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in significant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is enhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously learn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking. Experimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial reasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing foundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics, autonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches typically incorporate physical priors to animate 3D representations, but these methods suffer from significant limitations: they not only require users lacking physics expertise to manually specify material properties but also struggle to effectively handle the generation of multi-material composite objects. To address these challenges, we propose Phys4DGen, a novel 4D generation framework that integrates multi-material composition perception with physical simulation. The framework achieves automated, physically plausible 4D generation through three innovative modules: first, the 3D Material Grouping module partitions heterogeneous material regions on 3D representations' surfaces via semantic segmentation; second, the Internal Physical Structure Discovery module constructs the mechanical structure of object interiors; finally, we distill physical prior knowledge from multimodal large language models to enable rapid and automatic material properties identification for both objects' surfaces and interiors. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Phys4DGen can generate high-fidelity 4D content with physical realism in open-world scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025.
