| **[MissionHD: Data-Driven Refinement of Reasoning Graph Structure through Hyperdimensional Causal Path Encoding and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Video Anomaly Detection via Deep Learning: Human, Vehicle, and Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14203v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GV-VAD : Exploring Video Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00312v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DAMS:Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20629v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ACM MM 2025; Code: https://github.com/YihuaJerry/EventVAD</p></details> |
| **[HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17394v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 |

We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP.

| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |

| **[TOMATO: Assessing Visual Temporal Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23266v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks.

However, current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames; (2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3) confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA (76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video understanding.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens, enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/OmniVideo_project/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding.

Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks.

To address this limitation, we propose a one-shot learning framework PVChat, the first personalized ViLLM that enables subject-aware question answering (QA) from a single video for each subject. Our approach optimizes a Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) enhanced ViLLM on a synthetically augmented video-QA dataset, leveraging a progressive image-to-video learning strategy. Specifically, we introduce an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types: existence, appearance, action, and location inquiries. To enhance subject-specific learning, we propose a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: (1) Smooth Proximity Regularization for progressive learning through exponential distance scaling and (2) Head Activation Enhancement for balanced attention routing. Finally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning, enabling a gradual learning process from static attributes to dynamic representations. We evaluate PVChat on diverse datasets covering medical scenarios, TV series, anime, and real-world footage, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding after learning from a single video, compared to state-of-the-art ViLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents.

However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs, whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models. Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding.

Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.</p></details> |  |

Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |

However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://project.ironieser.cc/mmtok</p></details> |

We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

The modular framework was developed implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from 38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |

Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |

It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is at https://zesen01.github.io/jigsaw-puzzles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main conference</p></details> |

Clinicians must make diagnoses based on a handful of images and brief descriptions, without the benefit of physical exams, second opinions, or reference materials. While many medical AI systems attempt to bridge these gaps with domain-specific fine-tuning, this work hypothesized that mimicking clinical reasoning processes could offer a more effective path forward. This study tested seven vision-language models on medical visual question answering across six configurations: baseline models, fine-tuned variants, and both augmented with either reasoning layers that combine multiple model perspectives, analogous to peer consultation, or retrieval-augmented generation that incorporates medical literature at inference time, serving a role similar to reference-checking. While fine-tuning degraded performance in four of seven models with an average 30\% decrease, baseline models collapsed on test data. Clinical-inspired architectures, meanwhile, achieved up to 70\% accuracy, maintaining performance on unseen data while generating explainable, literature-grounded outputs critical for clinical adoption. These findings demonstrate that medical AI succeeds by reconstructing the collaborative and evidence-based practices fundamental to clinical diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting: Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny. Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 reference, 3 figures, icassp 2026</p></details> |

However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

| **[3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v5)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoRe: Position-Reweighted Visual Token Pruning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17807v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input. However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates whether a similar scaling relationship exist for vision-language models with respect to the number of vision tokens. A mathematical framework is developed to characterize a relationship between vision token number and the expected divergence of distance between vision-referencing sequences. The theoretical analysis reveals two distinct scaling regimes: sublinear scaling for less vision tokens and linear scaling for more vision tokens. This aligns with model performance relationships of the form \(S(n) \approx c / n^{\alpha(n)}\), where the scaling exponent relates to the correlation structure between vision token representations. Empirical validations across multiple vision-language benchmarks show that model performance matches the prediction from scaling relationship. The findings contribute to understanding vision token scaling in transformers through a theoretical framework that complements empirical observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSADF: Thinking Fast and Slow for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08189v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2), demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules: System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for both unseen and known tasks.</p></details> |  |

To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

However, they often fail to meet users' actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments, comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs, these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.</p></details> |  |

We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel OOD detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing methods.

| **[Dynamic Embedding of Hierarchical Visual Features for Efficient Vision-Language Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17638v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and inference.</p></details> |  |

Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multimodal generative retrieval -- particularly those leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as retrievers -- have shown promise. However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios and struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn dialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance through iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically relies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical reasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are rarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are often ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding responses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational multimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever, further augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves retrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent throughout the dialogue. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements, with average gains of 14.5 points in MRR and 10.6 points in nDCG@1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forgotten Polygons: Multimodal Large Language Models are Shape-Blind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15969v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite strong performance on vision-language tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with mathematical problem-solving, with both open-source and state-of-the-art models falling short of human performance on visual-math benchmarks. To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis, integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally, we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence, resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

For SLT models to perform this task successfully, they must bridge the modality gap and identify subtle variations in sign language components to understand their meanings accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gloss-free SLT framework called Multimodal Sign Language Translation (MMSLT), which leverages the representational capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we use MLLMs to generate detailed textual descriptions of sign language components. Then, through our proposed multimodal-language pre-training module, we integrate these description features with sign video features to align them within the spoken sentence space.

However, the increased number of images in MVQA inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments, which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Align...</summary><p>Aligned with ICCV 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> |

Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.</p></details> | 17 figures |
| **[Hidden in Plain Sight: Reasoning in Underspecified and Misspecified Scenarios for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00258v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17675v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.</p></details> | Preprint |

This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns, detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis. The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93, surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection systems using LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACL 2025 SRW, 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Traveling Across Languages: Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Consistency in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15075v5)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first version of this paper mistakenly included a prompt injection phrase, which was inappropriate and unprofessional.

| **[SIFThinker: Spatially-Aware Image Focus for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06259v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Continual Learning for Generative AI: From LLMs to MLLMs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13045v4)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models has empowered modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models are fundamentally constrained by \emph{catastrophic forgetting}, \ie~a persistent challenge where models experience performance degradation on previously learned tasks when adapting to new tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative AI in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative AI models, encompassing large language models, multimodal large language models, vision-language-action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, thereby providing deeper insights into the field.

| **[MaRVL-QA: A Benchmark for Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17180v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations. Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRASP: Geospatial pixel Reasoning viA Structured Policy learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17102v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions. Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain (OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to 54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be released open-source.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Zero-shot Multimodal Document Retrieval via Cross-modal Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17079v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded information retrieval beyond purely textual inputs, enabling retrieval from complex real world documents that combine text and visuals. However, most documents are private either owned by individuals or confined within corporate silos and current retrievers struggle when faced with unseen domains or languages. To address this gap, we introduce PREMIR, a simple yet effective framework that leverages the broad knowledge of an MLLM to generate cross modal pre questions (preQs) before retrieval. Unlike earlier multimodal retrievers that compare embeddings in a single vector space, PREMIR leverages preQs from multiple complementary modalities to expand the scope of matching to the token level. Experiments show that PREMIR achieves state of the art performance on out of distribution benchmarks, including closed domain and multilingual settings, outperforming strong baselines across all retrieval metrics. We confirm the contribution of each component through in depth ablation studies, and qualitative analyses of the generated preQs further highlight the model's robustness in real world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[EGOILLUSION: Benchmarking Hallucinations in Egocentric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12687v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal LLMs See Sentiment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16873v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Beyond Emotion Recognition: A Multi-Turn Multimodal Emotion Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16859v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR) benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects, including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant challenges with this task.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2025 |
