| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: (i) for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences; (ii) regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analysis, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. Some experimentations are been made to compare these two architectural configurations with each other, and evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis and surveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. To address these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires no training and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm without physical contact. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Bounding Boxes and Probabilistic Graphical Models: Video Anomaly Detection Simplified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06000v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we formulate the task of Video Anomaly Detection as a probabilistic analysis of object bounding boxes. We hypothesize that the representation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to successfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this approach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer computational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within video surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model based on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in human-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less than 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach constitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with prior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the results we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art results on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at GCPR 2024, after peer review.

Despite extensive research efforts, there remains a lack of concise reviews that provide insightful guidance for researchers. Such reviews would serve as quick references to grasp current challenges, research trends, and future directions. In this paper, we present such a review, examining models and datasets from various perspectives. We emphasize the critical relationship between model and dataset, where the quality and diversity of datasets profoundly influence model performance, and dataset development adapts to the evolving needs of emerging approaches. Our review identifies practical issues, including the absence of comprehensive datasets with diverse scenarios. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Multi-Scenario Anomaly Detection (MSAD), comprising 14 distinct scenarios captured from various camera views. Our dataset has diverse motion patterns and challenging variations, such as different lighting and weather conditions, providing a robust foundation for training superior models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of recent representative models using MSAD and highlight its potential in addressing the challenges of detecting anomalies across diverse and evolving surveillance scenarios.

This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Low-Latency Video Anonymization for Crowd Anomaly Detection: Privacy vs. Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18717v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence promise ample potential in monitoring applications with surveillance cameras. However, concerns about privacy and model bias have made it challenging to utilize them in public. Although de-identification approaches have been proposed in the literature, aiming to achieve a certain level of anonymization, most of them employ deep learning models that are computationally demanding for real-time edge deployment. In this study, we revisit conventional anonymization solutions for privacy protection and real-time video anomaly detection (VAD) applications. We propose a novel lightweight adaptive anonymization for VAD (LA3D) that employs dynamic adjustment to enhance privacy protection. We evaluated the approaches on publicly available privacy and VAD data sets to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different anonymization techniques and highlight the promising efficacy of our approach. Our experiment demonstrates that LA3D enables substantial improvement in the privacy anonymization capability without majorly degrading VAD efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>16pag...</summary><p>16pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEGO: Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | Research paper |

| **[Interleaving One-Class and Weakly-Supervised Models with Adaptive Thresholding for Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13551v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has been extensively studied under the settings of One-Class Classification (OCC) and Weakly-Supervised learning (WS), which however both require laborious human-annotated normal/abnormal labels. In this paper, we study Unsupervised VAD (UVAD) that does not depend on any label by combining OCC and WS into a unified training framework. Specifically, we extend OCC to weighted OCC (wOCC) and propose a wOCC-WS interleaving training module, where the two models automatically generate pseudo-labels for each other. We face two challenges to make the combination effective: (1) Models' performance fluctuates occasionally during the training process due to the inevitable randomness of the pseudo labels. (2) Thresholds are needed to divide pseudo labels, making the training depend on the accuracy of user intervention. For the first problem, we propose to use wOCC requiring soft labels instead of OCC trained with hard zero/one labels, as soft labels exhibit high consistency throughout different training cycles while hard labels are prone to sudden changes. For the second problem, we repeat the interleaving training module multiple times, during which we propose an adaptive thresholding strategy that can progressively refine a rough threshold to a relatively optimal threshold, which reduces the influence of user interaction. A benefit of employing OCC and WS methods to compose a UVAD method is that we can incorporate the most recent OCC or WS model into our framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UVAD framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Appearance Blur-driven AutoEncoder and Motion-guided Memory Module for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17608v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) often learns the distribution of normal samples and detects the anomaly through measuring significant deviations, but the undesired generalization may reconstruct a few anomalies thus suppressing the deviations. Meanwhile, most VADs cannot cope with cross-dataset validation for new target domains, and few-shot methods must laboriously rely on model-tuning from the target domain to complete domain adaptation. To address these problems, we propose a novel VAD method with a motion-guided memory module to achieve cross-dataset validation with zero-shot. First, we add Gaussian blur to the raw appearance images, thereby constructing the global pseudo-anomaly, which serves as the input to the network. Then, we propose multi-scale residual channel attention to deblur the pseudo-anomaly in normal samples. Next, memory items are obtained by recording the motion features in the training phase, which are used to retrieve the motion features from the raw information in the testing phase. Lastly, our method can ignore the blurred real anomaly through attention and rely on motion memory items to increase the normality gap between normal and abnormal motion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with cross-domain methods, our method achieves competitive performance without adaptation during testing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, the inherent unpredictability of anomalies and the scarcity of anomaly samples present significant challenges for unsupervised learning methods. To overcome the limitations of unsupervised learning, which stem from a lack of comprehensive prior knowledge about anomalies, we propose VLAVAD (Video-Language Models Assisted Anomaly Detection). Our method employs a cross-modal pre-trained model that leverages the inferential capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with a Selective-Prompt Adapter (SPA) for selecting semantic space. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence State Space Module (S3M) that detects temporal inconsistencies in semantic features. By mapping high-dimensional visual features to low-dimensional semantic ones, our method significantly enhance the interpretability of unsupervised anomaly detection. Our proposed approach effectively tackles the challenge of detecting elusive anomalies that are hard to discern over periods, achieving SOTA on the challenging ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion-based Weekly Supervised Anomaly Violence Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11223v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is a crucial area in computer vision for developing intelligent surveillance systems. This system uses three feature streams: RGB video, optical flow, and audio signals, where each stream extracts complementary spatial and temporal features using an enhanced attention module to improve detection accuracy and robustness. In the first stream, we employed an attention-based, multi-stage feature enhancement approach to improve spatial and temporal features from the RGB video where the first stage consists of a ViT-based CLIP module, with top-k features concatenated in parallel with I3D and Temporal Contextual Aggregation (TCA) based rich spatiotemporal features. The second stage effectively captures temporal dependencies using the Uncertainty-Regulated Dual Memory Units (UR-DMU) model, which learns representations of normal and abnormal data simultaneously, and the third stage is employed to select the most relevant spatiotemporal features. The second stream extracted enhanced attention-based spatiotemporal features from the flow data modality-based feature by taking advantage of the integration of the deep learning and attention module. The audio stream captures auditory cues using an attention module integrated with the VGGish model, aiming to detect anomalies based on sound patterns. These streams enrich the model by incorporating motion and audio signals often indicative of abnormal events undetectable through visual analysis alone. The concatenation of the multimodal fusion leverages the strengths of each modality, resulting in a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy and robustness across three datasets. The extensive experiment and high performance with the three benchmark datasets proved the effectiveness of the proposed system over the existing state-of-the-art system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abnormal Event Detection In Videos Using Deep Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09804v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormal event detection or anomaly detection in surveillance videos is currently a challenge because of the diversity of possible events. Due to the lack of anomalous events at training time, anomaly detection requires the design of learning methods without supervision. In this work we propose an unsupervised approach for video anomaly detection with the aim to jointly optimize the objectives of the deep neural network and the anomaly detection task using a hybrid architecture. Initially, a convolutional autoencoder is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner with a fusion of depth, motion and appearance features. In the second step, we utilize the encoder part of the pre-trained autoencoder and extract the embeddings of the fused input. Now, we jointly train/ fine tune the encoder to map the embeddings to a hypercenter. Thus, embeddings of normal data fall near the hypercenter, whereas embeddings of anomalous data fall far away from the hypercenter.</p></details> |  |

As a long-standing task in the field of computer vision, VAD has witnessed much good progress. In the era of deep learning, with the explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity, a great variety of deep learning based methods are constantly emerging for the VAD task, greatly improving the generalization ability of detection algorithms and broadening the application scenarios. Therefore, such a multitude of methods and a large body of literature make a comprehensive survey a pressing necessity. In this paper, we present an extensive and comprehensive research review, covering the spectrum of five different categories, namely, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, fully supervised, unsupervised and open-set supervised VAD, and we also delve into the latest VAD works based on pre-trained large models, remedying the limitations of past reviews in terms of only focusing on semi-supervised VAD and small model based methods. For the VAD task with different levels of supervision, we construct a well-organized taxonomy, profoundly discuss the characteristics of different types of methods, and show their performance comparisons. In addition, this review involves the public datasets, open-source codes, and evaluation metrics covering all the aforementioned VAD tasks. Finally, we provide several important research directions for the VAD community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Current methods primarily include appearance-based and action-based techniques. Appearance-based methods rely on low-level visual features such as color, texture, and shape. They learn a large number of pixel patterns and features related to known scenes during training, making them effective in detecting anomalies within these familiar contexts. However, when encountering new or significantly changed scenes, i.e., unknown scenes, they often fail because existing SOTA methods do not effectively capture the relationship between actions and their surrounding scenes, resulting in low generalization. In contrast, action-based methods focus on detecting anomalies in human actions but are usually less informative because they tend to overlook the relationship between actions and their scenes, leading to incorrect detection. For instance, the normal event of running on the beach and the abnormal event of running on the street might both be considered normal due to the lack of scene information. In short, current methods struggle to integrate low-level visual and high-level action features, leading to poor anomaly detection in varied and complex scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoupling-based architecture for human-related video anomaly detection (DecoAD). DecoAD significantly improves the integration of visual and action features through the decoupling and interweaving of scenes and actions, thereby enabling a more intuitive and accurate understanding of complex behaviors and scenes. DecoAD supports fully supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised settings.</p></details> | 13pages, 9 figures |
| **[Learn Suspected Anomalies from Event Prompts for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01169v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most models for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) rely on multiple instance learning, aiming to distinguish normal and abnormal snippets without specifying the type of anomaly. However, the ambiguous nature of anomaly definitions across contexts may introduce inaccuracy in discriminating abnormal and normal events. To show the model what is anomalous, a novel framework is proposed to guide the learning of suspected anomalies from event prompts. Given a textual prompt dictionary of potential anomaly events and the captions generated from anomaly videos, the semantic anomaly similarity between them could be calculated to identify the suspected events for each video snippet. It enables a new multi-prompt learning process to constrain the visual-semantic features across all videos, as well as provides a new way to label pseudo anomalies for self-training. To demonstrate its effectiveness, comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies are conducted on four datasets, namely XD-Violence, UCF-Crime, TAD, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of AP or AUC (86.5\%, \hl{90.4}\%, 94.4\%, and 97.4\%). Furthermore, it shows promising performance in open-set and cross-dataset cases. The data, code, and models can be found at: \url{https://github.com/shiwoaz/lap}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Jigsaw Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12172v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD) is a crucial task in computer vision. Accurately identifying abnormal patterns or events enables operators to promptly detect suspicious activities, thereby enhancing safety. Achieving this demands a comprehensive understanding of human motions, both at body and region levels, while also accounting for the wide variations of performing a single action. However, existing studies fail to simultaneously address these crucial properties. This paper introduces a novel, practical and lightweight framework, namely Graph-Jigsaw Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection (GiCiSAD) to overcome the challenges associated with SVAD. GiCiSAD consists of three novel modules: the Graph Attention-based Forecasting module to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the data, the Graph-level Jigsaw Puzzle Maker module to distinguish subtle region-level discrepancies between normal and abnormal motions, and the Graph-based Conditional Diffusion model to generate a wide spectrum of human motions. Extensive experiments on four widely used skeleton-based video datasets show that GiCiSAD outperforms existing methods with significantly fewer training parameters, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). 17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[PoseWatch: A Transformer-based Architecture for Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection Using Spatio-temporal Pose Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |
| **[What Matters in Autonomous Driving Anomaly Detection: A Weakly Supervised Horizon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05562v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) in autonomous driving scenario is an important task, however it involves several challenges due to the ego-centric views and moving camera. Due to this, it remains largely under-explored. While recent developments in weakly-supervised VAD methods have shown remarkable progress in detecting critical real-world anomalies in static camera scenario, the development and validation of such methods are yet to be explored for moving camera VAD. This is mainly due to existing datasets like DoTA not following training pre-conditions of weakly-supervised learning. In this paper, we aim to promote weakly-supervised method development for autonomous driving VAD. We reorganize the DoTA dataset and aim to validate recent powerful weakly-supervised VAD methods on moving camera scenarios. Further, we provide a detailed analysis of what modifications on state-of-the-art methods can significantly improve the detection performance. Towards this, we propose a "feature transformation block" and through experimentation we show that our propositions can empower existing weakly-supervised VAD methods significantly in improving the VAD in autonomous driving.

| **[Cross-Domain Learning for Video Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05191v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automates the identification of unusual events, such as security threats in surveillance videos. In real-world applications, VAD models must effectively operate in cross-domain settings, identifying rare anomalies and scenarios not well-represented in the training data. However, existing cross-domain VAD methods focus on unsupervised learning, resulting in performance that falls short of real-world expectations. Since acquiring weak supervision, i.e., video-level labels, for the source domain is cost-effective, we conjecture that combining it with external unlabeled data has notable potential to enhance cross-domain performance. To this end, we introduce a novel weakly-supervised framework for Cross-Domain Learning (CDL) in VAD that incorporates external data during training by estimating its prediction bias and adaptively minimizing that using the predicted uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL framework through comprehensive experiments conducted in various configurations on two large-scale VAD datasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. Our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art works in cross-domain evaluations, achieving an average absolute improvement of 19.6% on UCF-Crime and 12.87% on XD-Violence.</p></details> |  |
| **[CKNN: Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor for Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03014v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD). The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled videos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a significant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in the feature space. We refer to this property as the "Anomaly Cluster" issue. The condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training conventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often leads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new method called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out the Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection capability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a significant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed cleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem. We evaluate the proposed method on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that CKNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art UVAD method by up to 8.5% (from 82.0 to 89.0) in terms of AUROC. Moreover, we emphasize that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art method trained using anomaly-free data.</p></details> |  |

However, anomaly detection is complex since anomalous events are rare and because it is an open set recognition task, i.e., what is anomalous at inference has not been observed at training. We propose COSKAD, a novel model that encodes skeletal human motion by a graph convolutional network and learns to COntract SKeletal kinematic embeddings onto a latent hypersphere of minimum volume for Video Anomaly Detection. We propose three latent spaces: the commonly-adopted Euclidean and the novel spherical and hyperbolic. All variants outperform the state-of-the-art on the most recent UBnormal dataset, for which we contribute a human-related version with annotated skeletons. COSKAD sets a new state-of-the-art on the human-related versions of ShanghaiTech Campus and CUHK Avenue, with performance comparable to video-based methods.

Expanding the discriminative boundary between normal and abnormal events to enhance performance is the common goal and challenge of VAD. To address this problem, we propose a Bidirectional Skip-frame Prediction (BiSP) network based on a dual-stream autoencoder, from the perspective of learning the intra-domain disparity between different features. The BiSP skips frames in the training phase to achieve the forward and backward frame prediction respectively, and in the testing phase, it utilizes bidirectional consecutive frames to co-predict the same intermediate frames, thus expanding the degree of disparity between normal and abnormal events. The BiSP designs the variance channel attention and context spatial attention from the perspectives of movement patterns and object scales, respectively, thus ensuring the maximization of the disparity between normal and abnormal in the feature extraction and delivery with different dimensions. Extensive experiments from four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BiSP, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Follow the Rules: Reasoning for Video Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10299v2)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is crucial for applications such as security surveillance and autonomous driving. However, existing VAD methods provide little rationale behind detection, hindering public trust in real-world deployments. In this paper, we approach VAD with a reasoning framework. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning ability, we find that their direct use falls short of VAD. Specifically, the implicit knowledge pre-trained in LLMs focuses on general context and thus may not apply to every specific real-world VAD scenario, leading to inflexibility and inaccuracy. To address this, we propose AnomalyRuler, a novel rule-based reasoning framework for VAD with LLMs. AnomalyRuler comprises two main stages: induction and deduction. In the induction stage, the LLM is fed with few-shot normal reference samples and then summarizes these normal patterns to induce a set of rules for detecting anomalies. The deduction stage follows the induced rules to spot anomalous frames in test videos. Additionally, we design rule aggregation, perception smoothing, and robust reasoning strategies to further enhance AnomalyRuler's robustness. AnomalyRuler is the first reasoning approach for the one-class VAD task, which requires only few-normal-shot prompting without the need for full-shot training, thereby enabling fast adaption to various VAD scenarios. Comprehensive experiments across four VAD benchmarks demonstrate AnomalyRuler's state-of-the-art detection performance and reasoning ability.

To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS.

| **[A Lightweight Video Anomaly Detection Model with Weak Supervision and Adaptive Instance Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05330v2)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is to determine whether there are any abnormal events, behaviors or objects in a given video, which enables effective and intelligent public safety management. As video anomaly labeling is both time-consuming and expensive, most existing works employ unsupervised or weakly supervised learning methods. This paper focuses on weakly supervised video anomaly detection, in which the training videos are labeled whether or not they contain any anomalies, but there is no information about which frames the anomalies are located. However, the uncertainty of weakly labeled data and the large model size prevent existing methods from wide deployment in real scenarios, especially the resource-limit situations such as edge-computing. In this paper, we develop a lightweight video anomaly detection model. On the one hand, we propose an adaptive instance selection strategy, which is based on the model's current status to select confident instances, thereby mitigating the uncertainty of weakly labeled data and subsequently promoting the model's performance. On the other hand, we design a lightweight multi-level temporal correlation attention module and an hourglass-shaped fully connected layer to construct the model, which can reduce the model parameters to only 0.56\% of the existing methods (e.g. RTFM). Our extensive experiments on two public datasets UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech show that our model can achieve comparable or even superior AUC score compared to the state-of-the-art methods, with a significantly reduced number of model parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection in 10 Years: A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19387v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) holds immense importance across diverse domains such as surveillance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While numerous surveys focus on conventional VAD methods, they often lack depth in exploring specific approaches and emerging trends. This survey explores deep learning-based VAD, expanding beyond traditional supervised training paradigms to encompass emerging weakly supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A prominent feature of this review is the investigation of core challenges within the VAD paradigms including large-scale datasets, features extraction, learning methods, loss functions, regularization, and anomaly score prediction. Moreover, this review also investigates the vision language models (VLMs) as potent feature extractors for VAD. VLMs integrate visual data with textual descriptions or spoken language from videos, enabling a nuanced understanding of scenes crucial for anomaly detection. By addressing these challenges and proposing future research directions, this review aims to foster the development of robust and efficient VAD systems leveraging the capabilities of VLMs for enhanced anomaly detection in complex real-world scenarios. This comprehensive analysis seeks to bridge existing knowledge gaps, provide researchers with valuable insights, and contribute to shaping the future of VAD research.</p></details> |  |

To address these drawbacks, we propose Holmes-VAD, a novel framework that leverages precise temporal supervision and rich multimodal instructions to enable accurate anomaly localization and comprehensive explanations. Firstly, towards unbiased and explainable VAD system, we construct the first large-scale multimodal VAD instruction-tuning benchmark, i.e., VAD-Instruct50k. This dataset is created using a carefully designed semi-automatic labeling paradigm. Efficient single-frame annotations are applied to the collected untrimmed videos, which are then synthesized into high-quality analyses of both abnormal and normal video clips using a robust off-the-shelf video captioner and a large language model (LLM). Building upon the VAD-Instruct50k dataset, we develop a customized solution for interpretable video anomaly detection. We train a lightweight temporal sampler to select frames with high anomaly response and fine-tune a multimodal large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory content. Extensive experimental results validate the generality and interpretability of the proposed Holmes-VAD, establishing it as a novel interpretable technique for real-world video anomaly analysis. To support the community, our benchmark and model will be publicly available at https://holmesvad.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DA-Flow: Dual Attention Normalizing Flow for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02976v1)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperation between temporal convolutional networks (TCN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a processing module has shown promising results in skeleton-based video anomaly detection (SVAD). However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and flops. Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest number of parameters. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hawk: Learning to Understand Open-World Video Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16886v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems can autonomously monitor and identify disturbances, reducing the need for manual labor and associated costs. However, current VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic understanding of scenes and minimal user interaction. Additionally, the prevalent data scarcity in existing datasets restricts their applicability in open-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Hawk, a novel framework that leverages interactive large Visual Language Models (VLM) to interpret video anomalies precisely. Recognizing the difference in motion information between abnormal and normal videos, Hawk explicitly integrates motion modality to enhance anomaly identification. To reinforce motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss within the motion and video space, guiding the video branch to focus on the motion modality. Moreover, to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervisory relationship between motion and its linguistic representation. Furthermore, we have annotated over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling effective training across diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000 question-answering pairs for users' open-world questions. The final results demonstrate that Hawk achieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in both video description generation and question-answering. Our codes/dataset/demo will be released at https://github.com/jqtangust/hawk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of Video Anomaly Detection in the Wild: Online Learning and Inference for Real-world Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18747v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) identifies unusual activities in video streams, a key technology with broad applications ranging from surveillance to healthcare. Tackling VAD in real-life settings poses significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Many research initiatives neglect these complexities, often concentrating on traditional testing methods that fail to account for performance on unseen datasets, creating a gap between theoretical models and their real-world utility. Online learning is a potential strategy to mitigate this issue by allowing models to adapt to new information continuously. This paper assesses how well current VAD algorithms can adjust to real-life conditions through an online learning framework, particularly those based on pose analysis, for their efficiency and privacy advantages. Our proposed framework enables continuous model updates with streaming data from novel environments, thus mirroring actual world challenges and evaluating the models' ability to adapt in real-time while maintaining accuracy. We investigate three state-of-the-art models in this setting, focusing on their adaptability across different domains. Our findings indicate that, even under the most challenging conditions, our online learning approach allows a model to preserve 89.39% of its original effectiveness compared to its offline-trained counterpart in a specific target domain.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection (PAD) has drawn considerable attention from the research community due to several inherent advantages over pixel-based approaches despite the occasional suboptimal performance. Specifically, PAD is characterized by reduced computational complexity, intrinsic privacy preservation, and the mitigation of concerns related to discrimination and bias against specific demographic groups. This paper introduces TSGAD, a novel human-centric Two-Stream Graph-Improved Anomaly Detection leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and trajectory prediction. TSGAD aims to explore the possibility of utilizing VAEs as a new approach for pose-based human-centric VAD alongside the benefits of trajectory prediction. We demonstrate TSGAD's effectiveness through comprehensive experimentation on benchmark datasets. TSGAD demonstrates comparable results with state-of-the-art methods showcasing the potential of adopting variational autoencoders. This suggests a promising direction for future research endeavors.

| **[IPAD: Industrial Process Anomaly Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15033v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task aiming to recognize anomalies in video frames, and existing large-scale VAD researches primarily focus on road traffic and human activity scenes. In industrial scenes, there are often a variety of unpredictable anomalies, and the VAD method can play a significant role in these scenarios. However, there is a lack of applicable datasets and methods specifically tailored for industrial production scenarios due to concerns regarding privacy and security. To bridge this gap, we propose a new dataset, IPAD, specifically designed for VAD in industrial scenarios. The industrial processes in our dataset are chosen through on-site factory research and discussions with engineers. This dataset covers 16 different industrial devices and contains over 6 hours of both synthetic and real-world video footage. Moreover, we annotate the key feature of the industrial process, ie, periodicity. Based on the proposed dataset, we introduce a period memory module and a sliding window inspection mechanism to effectively investigate the periodic information in a basic reconstruction model. Our framework leverages LoRA adapter to explore the effective migration of pretrained models, which are initially trained using synthetic data, into real-world scenarios. Our proposed dataset and method will fill the gap in the field of industrial video anomaly detection and drive the process of video understanding tasks as well as smart factory deployment.</p></details> |  |

Generating fine-grained pseudo-labels based on weak-label and then self-training a classifier is currently a promising solution. However, since the existing methods use only RGB visual modality and the utilization of category text information is neglected, thus limiting the generation of more accurate pseudo-labels and affecting the performance of self-training. Inspired by the manual labeling process based on the event description, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-label generation and self-training framework based on Text Prompt with Normality Guidance (TPWNG) for WSVAD. Our idea is to transfer the rich language-visual knowledge of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for aligning the video event description text and corresponding video frames to generate pseudo-labels. Specifically, We first fine-tune the CLIP for domain adaptation by designing two ranking losses and a distributional inconsistency loss. Further, we propose a learnable text prompt mechanism with the assist of a normality visual prompt to further improve the matching accuracy of video event description text and video frames. Then, we design a pseudo-label generation module based on the normality guidance to infer reliable frame-level pseudo-labels. Finally, we introduce a temporal context self-adaptive learning module to learn the temporal dependencies of different video events more flexibly and accurately. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, UCF-Crime and XD-Viole</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

However, in real-world environments, security cameras observe the same scene for months or years at a time, and the notion of anomalous behavior critically depends on context, such as the time of day, day of week, or schedule of events. Here, we propose a context-aware video anomaly detection algorithm, Trinity, specifically targeted to these scenarios. Trinity is especially well-suited to crowded scenes in which individuals cannot be easily tracked, and anomalies are due to speed, direction, or absence of group motion. Trinity is a contrastive learning framework that aims to learn alignments between context, appearance, and motion, and uses alignment quality to classify videos as normal or anomalous. We evaluate our algorithm on both conventional benchmarks and a public webcam-based dataset we collected that spans more than three months of activity.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing works mostly rely on training deep models to learn the distribution of normality with either video-level supervision, one-class supervision, or in an unsupervised setting. Training-based methods are prone to be domain-specific, thus being costly for practical deployment as any domain change will involve data collection and model training. In this paper, we radically depart from previous efforts and propose LAnguage-based VAD (LAVAD), a method tackling VAD in a novel, training-free paradigm, exploiting the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and existing vision-language models (VLMs). We leverage VLM-based captioning models to generate textual descriptions for each frame of any test video. With the textual scene description, we then devise a prompting mechanism to unlock the capability of LLMs in terms of temporal aggregation and anomaly score estimation, turning LLMs into an effective video anomaly detector. We further leverage modality-aligned VLMs and propose effective techniques based on cross-modal similarity for cleaning noisy captions and refining the LLM-based anomaly scores. We evaluate LAVAD on two large datasets featuring real-world surveillance scenarios (UCF-Crime and XD-Violence), showing that it outperforms both unsupervised and one-class methods without requiring any training or data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

As surveillance videos are privacy sensitive and the availability of large-scale video data may enable better US-VAD systems, collaborative learning can be highly rewarding in this setting. However, due to the extremely challenging nature of the US-VAD task, where learning is carried out without any annotations, privacy-preserving collaborative learning of US-VAD systems has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new baseline for anomaly detection capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance videos in a fully unsupervised fashion without any labels on a privacy-preserving participant-based distributed training configuration. Additionally, we propose three new evaluation protocols to benchmark anomaly detection approaches on various scenarios of collaborations and data availability. Based on these protocols, we modify existing VAD datasets to extensively evaluate our approach as well as existing US SOTA methods on two large-scale datasets including UCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

| **[Patch Spatio-Temporal Relation Prediction for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19111v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), aiming to identify abnormalities within a specific context and timeframe, is crucial for intelligent Video Surveillance Systems. While recent deep learning-based VAD models have shown promising results by generating high-resolution frames, they often lack competence in preserving detailed spatial and temporal coherence in video frames. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-supervised learning approach for VAD through an inter-patch relationship prediction task. Specifically, we introduce a two-branch vision transformer network designed to capture deep visual features of video frames, addressing spatial and temporal dimensions responsible for modeling appearance and motion patterns, respectively. The inter-patch relationship in each dimension is decoupled into inter-patch similarity and the order information of each patch. To mitigate memory consumption, we convert the order information prediction task into a multi-label learning problem, and the inter-patch similarity prediction task into a distance matrix regression problem. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing pixel-generation-based methods by a significant margin across three public benchmarks. Additionally, our approach outperforms other self-supervised learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constricting Normal Latent Space for Anomaly Detection with Normal-only Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16270v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to devise an anomaly detection model using only normal training data, an autoencoder (AE) is typically trained to reconstruct the data. As a result, the AE can extract normal representations in its latent space. During test time, since AE is not trained using real anomalies, it is expected to poorly reconstruct the anomalous data. However, several researchers have observed that it is not the case. In this work, we propose to limit the reconstruction capability of AE by introducing a novel latent constriction loss, which is added to the existing reconstruction loss. By using our method, no extra computational cost is added to the AE during test time. Evaluations using three video anomaly detection benchmark datasets, i.e., Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in limiting the reconstruction capability of AE, which leads to a better anomaly detection model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR Workshop 2024 (PML4LRS)</p></details> |

This lets us estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector using a modification of denoising score matching, a method that injects training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate hyperparameter selection, we model the distribution of noisy video features across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align the models for different levels of noise. At test time, we combine anomaly indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, both in the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup.</p></details> |  |

With the assistance of the state-of-the-art real-time open-world object detection model Yolo-World and specialized prompts, the proposed framework can identify anomalies within camera-captured frames that include any possible obstacles, then generate concise, audio-delivered descriptions emphasizing abnormalities, assist in safe visual navigation in complex circumstances. Moreover, our proposed framework leverages the advantages of LLMs and the open-vocabulary object detection model to achieve the dynamic scenario switch, which allows users to transition smoothly from scene to scene, which addresses the limitation of traditional visual navigation. Furthermore, this paper explored the performance contribution of different prompt components, provided the vision for future improvement in visual accessibility, and paved the way for LLMs in video anomaly detection and vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07042v3)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) with weak supervision has achieved remarkable performance in utilizing video-level labels to discriminate whether a video frame is normal or abnormal. However, current approaches are inherently limited to a closed-set setting and may struggle in open-world applications where there can be anomaly categories in the test data unseen during training. A few recent studies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting, open-set VAD, which aims to detect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However, such a setting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores, having no ability to recognize the specific categories of anomalies, despite the fact that this ability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems. This paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD), in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to detect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose a model that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks -- class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification -- and jointly optimizes both tasks. Particularly, we devise a semantic knowledge injection module to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the detection task, and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo unseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the classification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies substantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a variety of seen and unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on OVVAD task.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Despite significant progress, these methods still suffer from unsatisfactory results such as numerous false alarms, primarily due to the absence of precise temporal anomaly annotation. In this paper, we present a novel labeling paradigm, termed "glance annotation", to achieve a better balance between anomaly detection accuracy and annotation cost. Specifically, glance annotation is a random frame within each abnormal event, which can be easily accessed and is cost-effective. To assess its effectiveness, we manually annotate the glance annotations for two standard video anomaly detection datasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. Additionally, we propose a customized GlanceVAD method, that leverages gaussian kernels as the basic unit to compose the temporal anomaly distribution, enabling the learning of diverse and robust anomaly representations from the glance annotations. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we verify that the proposed labeling paradigm can achieve an excellent trade-off between annotation cost and model performance. Extensive experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our GlanceVAD approach, which significantly outperforms existing advanced unsupervised and weakly supervised methods. Code and annotations will be publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/GlanceVAD.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Towards Video Anomaly Retrieval from Video Anomaly Detection: New Benchmarks and Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12545v2)** | 2024-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been paid increasing attention due to its potential applications, its current dominant tasks focus on online detecting anomalies% at the frame level, which can be roughly interpreted as the binary or multiple event classification. However, such a setup that builds relationships between complicated anomalous events and single labels, e.g., ``vandalism'', is superficial, since single labels are deficient to characterize anomalous events. In reality, users tend to search a specific video rather than a series of approximate videos. Therefore, retrieving anomalous events using detailed descriptions is practical and positive but few researches focus on this. In this context, we propose a novel task called Video Anomaly Retrieval (VAR), which aims to pragmatically retrieve relevant anomalous videos by cross-modalities, e.g., language descriptions and synchronous audios. Unlike the current video retrieval where videos are assumed to be temporally well-trimmed with short duration, VAR is devised to retrieve long untrimmed videos which may be partially relevant to the given query. To achieve this, we present two large-scale VAR benchmarks, UCFCrime-AR and XDViolence-AR, constructed on top of prevalent anomaly datasets. Meanwhile, we design a model called Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN) for VAR. In ALAN, we propose an anomaly-led sampling to focus on key segments in long untrimmed videos. Then, we introduce an efficient pretext task to enhance semantic associations between video-text fine-grained representations. Besides, we leverage two complementary alignments to further match cross-modal contents. Experimental results on two benchmarks reveal the challenges of VAR task and also demonstrate the advantages of our tailored method.

While prior research has utilized graph convolution networks and self-attention mechanisms alongside multiple instance learning (MIL)-based classification loss to model temporal relations and learn discriminative features, these methods often employ multi-branch architectures to capture local and global dependencies separately, resulting in increased parameters and computational costs. Moreover, the coarse-grained interclass separability provided by the binary constraint of MIL-based loss neglects the fine-grained discriminability within anomalous classes. In response, this paper introduces a weakly supervised anomaly detection framework that focuses on efficient context modeling and enhanced semantic discriminability. We present a Temporal Context Aggregation (TCA) module that captures comprehensive contextual information by reusing the similarity matrix and implementing adaptive fusion. Additionally, we propose a Prompt-Enhanced Learning (PEL) module that integrates semantic priors using knowledge-based prompts to boost the discriminative capacity of context features while ensuring separability between anomaly sub-classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method's components, demonstrating competitive performance with reduced parameters and computational effort on three challenging benchmarks: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech datasets. Notably, our approach significantly improves the detection accuracy of certain anomaly sub-classes, underscoring its practical value and efficacy.

The use of videos with identifiable faces raises privacy concerns, especially when used in a hospital or community-based setting. Appearance-based features can also be sensitive to pixel-based noise, straining the anomaly detection methods to model the changes in the background and making it difficult to focus on the actions of humans in the foreground. Structural information in the form of skeletons describing the human motion in the videos is privacy-protecting and can overcome some of the problems posed by appearance-based features. In this paper, we present a survey of privacy-protecting deep learning anomaly detection methods using skeletons extracted from videos. We present a novel taxonomy of algorithms based on the various learning approaches. We conclude that skeleton-based approaches for anomaly detection can be a plausible privacy-protecting alternative for video anomaly detection. Lastly, we identify major open research questions and provide guidelines to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence</p></details> |

Anomaly-scoring-based methods have been prevailing for years but suffer from the high complexity of thresholding and low explanability of detection results. In this paper, we conduct pioneer research on equipping video-based large language models (VLLMs) in the framework of VAD, making the VAD model free from thresholds and able to explain the reasons for the detected anomalies. We introduce a novel network module Long-Term Context (LTC) to mitigate the incapability of VLLMs in long-range context modeling. We design a three-phase training method to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning VLLMs by substantially minimizing the requirements for VAD data and lowering the costs of annotating instruction-tuning data. Our trained model achieves the top performance on the anomaly videos of the UCF-Crime and TAD benchmarks, with the AUC improvements of +3.86\% and +4.96\%, respectively. More impressively, our approach can provide textual explanations for detected anomalies.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

An open and worthwhile problem is efficiently adapting such a strong model to the video domain and designing a robust video anomaly detector. In this work, we propose VadCLIP, a new paradigm for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) by leveraging the frozen CLIP model directly without any pre-training and fine-tuning process. Unlike current works that directly feed extracted features into the weakly supervised classifier for frame-level binary classification, VadCLIP makes full use of fine-grained associations between vision and language on the strength of CLIP and involves dual branch. One branch simply utilizes visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, while the other fully leverages the fine-grained language-image alignment. With the benefit of dual branch, VadCLIP achieves both coarse-grained and fine-grained video anomaly detection by transferring pre-trained knowledge from CLIP to WSVAD task. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly-used benchmarks, demonstrating that VadCLIP achieves the best performance on both coarse-grained and fine-grained WSVAD, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Specifically, VadCLIP achieves 84.51% AP and 88.02% AUC on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, respectively.

However, prior studies typically divide videos into fixed-length segments without considering the complexity or duration of anomalies. Moreover, these studies usually just detect the most abnormal segments, potentially overlooking the completeness of anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Erasing Network (DE-Net) for weakly supervised video anomaly detection, which learns multi-scale temporal features. Specifically, to handle duration variations of abnormal events, we first propose a multi-scale temporal modeling module, capable of extracting features from segments of varying lengths and capturing both local and global visual information across different temporal scales. Then, we design a dynamic erasing strategy, which dynamically assesses the completeness of the detected anomalies and erases prominent abnormal segments in order to encourage the model to discover gentle abnormal segments in a video. The proposed method obtains favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art approaches on three datasets: XD-Violence, TAD, and UCF-Crime.

| **[Online Anomaly Detection over Live Social Video Streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08615v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social video anomaly is an observation in video streams that does not conform to a common pattern of dataset's behaviour. Social video anomaly detection plays a critical role in applications from e-commerce to e-learning. Traditionally, anomaly detection techniques are applied to find anomalies in video broadcasting. However, they neglect the live social video streams which contain interactive talk, speech, or lecture with audience. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for effectively online detecting Anomalies Over social Video LIve Streaming (AOVLIS). Specifically, we propose a novel deep neural network model called Coupling Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) that adaptively captures the history behaviours of the presenters and audience, and their mutual interactions to predict their behaviour at next time point over streams. Then we well integrate the CLSTM with a decoder layer, and propose a new reconstruction error-based scoring function $RE_{IA}$ to calculate the anomaly score of each video segment for anomaly detection. After that, we propose a novel model update scheme that incrementally maintains CLSTM and decoder. Moreover, we design a novel upper bound and ADaptive Optimisation Strategy (ADOS) for improving the efficiency of our solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of AOVLIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[BatchNorm-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15367v1)** | 2023-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD), where only video-level labels indicating the presence or absence of abnormal events are available, the primary challenge arises from the inherent ambiguity in temporal annotations of abnormal occurrences. Inspired by the statistical insight that temporal features of abnormal events often exhibit outlier characteristics, we propose a novel method, BN-WVAD, which incorporates BatchNorm into WVAD. In the proposed BN-WVAD, we leverage the Divergence of Feature from Mean vector (DFM) of BatchNorm as a reliable abnormality criterion to discern potential abnormal snippets in abnormal videos. The proposed DFM criterion is also discriminative for anomaly recognition and more resilient to label noise, serving as the additional anomaly score to amend the prediction of the anomaly classifier that is susceptible to noisy labels. Moreover, a batch-level selection strategy is devised to filter more abnormal snippets in videos where more abnormal events occur. The proposed BN-WVAD model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on UCF-Crime with an AUC of 87.24%, and XD-Violence, where AP reaches up to 84.93%. Our code implementation is accessible at https://github.com/cool-xuan/BN-WVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection using GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14095v1)** | 2023-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accounting for the increased concern for public safety, automatic abnormal event detection and recognition in a surveillance scene is crucial. It is a current open study subject because of its intricacy and utility. The identification of aberrant events automatically, it's a difficult undertaking because everyone's idea of abnormality is different. A typical occurrence in one circumstance could be seen as aberrant in another. Automatic anomaly identification becomes particularly challenging in the surveillance footage with a large crowd due to congestion and high occlusion. With the use of machine learning techniques, this thesis study aims to offer the solution for this use case so that human resources won't be required to keep an eye out for any unusual activity in the surveillance system records. We have developed a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based anomaly detection model. This model is trained such that it learns together about constructing a high dimensional picture space and determining the latent space from the video's context. The generator uses a residual Autoencoder architecture made up of a multi-stage channel attention-based decoder and a two-stream, deep convolutional encoder that can realise both spatial and temporal data. We have also offered a technique for refining the GAN model that reduces training time while also generalising the model by utilising transfer learning between datasets. Using a variety of assessment measures, we compare our model to the current state-of-the-art techniques on four benchmark datasets. The empirical findings indicate that, in comparison to existing techniques, our network performs favourably on all datasets.</p></details> |  |

Apart from the visual signal, video anomaly detection has also been addressed with the use of skeleton sequences. We propose a holistic representation of skeleton trajectories to learn expected motions across segments at different times. Our approach uses multitask learning to reconstruct any continuous unobserved temporal segment of the trajectory allowing the extrapolation of past or future segments and the interpolation of in-between segments. We use an end-to-end attention-based encoder-decoder. We encode temporally occluded trajectories, jointly learn latent representations of the occluded segments, and reconstruct trajectories based on expected motions across different temporal segments. Extensive experiments on three trajectory-based video anomaly detection datasets show the advantages and effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art results on anomaly detection in skeleton trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2023</p></details> |

Video anomaly detection (VAD) is well-studied in the one-class classification (OCC) and weakly supervised (WS) settings. However, fully unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection methods, which learn a complete system without any annotation or human supervision, have not been explored in depth. This is because the lack of any ground truth annotations significantly increases the magnitude of the VAD challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a simple-but-effective two-stage pseudo-label generation framework that produces segment-level (normal/anomaly) pseudo-labels, which can be further used to train a segment-level anomaly detector in a supervised manner. The proposed coarse-to-fine pseudo-label (C2FPL) generator employs carefully-designed hierarchical divisive clustering and statistical hypothesis testing to identify anomalous video segments from a set of completely unlabeled videos. The trained anomaly detector can be directly applied on segments of an unseen test video to obtain segment-level, and subsequently, frame-level anomaly predictions. Extensive studies on two large-scale public-domain datasets, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised approach achieves superior performance compared to all existing OCC and US methods , while yielding comparable performance to the state-of-the-art WS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2024</p></details> |

We introduce the novel method AnomalyCLIP, the first to combine Large Language and Vision (LLV) models, such as CLIP, with multiple instance learning for joint video anomaly detection and classification. Our approach specifically involves manipulating the latent CLIP feature space to identify the normal event subspace, which in turn allows us to effectively learn text-driven directions for abnormal events. When anomalous frames are projected onto these directions, they exhibit a large feature magnitude if they belong to a particular class. We also introduce a computationally efficient Transformer architecture to model short- and long-term temporal dependencies between frames, ultimately producing the final anomaly score and class prediction probabilities. We compare AnomalyCLIP against state-of-the-art methods considering three major anomaly detection benchmarks, i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, and XD-Violence, and empirically show that it outperforms baselines in recognising video anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Computer Vision and Image Understanding, project website and code are available at https://luca-zanella-dvl.github.io/AnomalyCLIP/</p></details> |
| **[Divide and Conquer in Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Review and New Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14622v2)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a complex task, and the principle of "divide and conquer" is often regarded as an effective approach to tackling intricate issues. It's noteworthy that recent methods in video anomaly detection have revealed the application of the divide and conquer philosophy (albeit with distinct perspectives from traditional usage), yielding impressive outcomes. This paper systematically reviews these literatures from six dimensions, aiming to enhance the use of the divide and conquer strategy in video anomaly detection. Furthermore, based on the insights gained from this review, a novel approach is presented, which integrates human skeletal frameworks with video data analysis techniques. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset, surpassing all existing advanced methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Benchmark: Detecting Diverse Anomalies in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01904v1)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) plays a crucial role in modern surveillance systems, aiming to identify various anomalies in real-world situations. However, current benchmark datasets predominantly emphasize simple, single-frame anomalies such as novel object detection. This narrow focus restricts the advancement of VAD models. In this research, we advocate for an expansion of VAD investigations to encompass intricate anomalies that extend beyond conventional benchmark boundaries. To facilitate this, we introduce two datasets, HMDB-AD and HMDB-Violence, to challenge models with diverse action-based anomalies. These datasets are derived from the HMDB51 action recognition dataset. We further present Multi-Frame Anomaly Detection (MFAD), a novel method built upon the AI-VAD framework. AI-VAD utilizes single-frame features such as pose estimation and deep image encoding, and two-frame features such as object velocity. They then apply a density estimation algorithm to compute anomaly scores. To address complex multi-frame anomalies, we add a deep video encoding features capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and logistic regression to enhance final score calculation. Experimental results confirm our assumptions, highlighting existing models limitations with new anomaly types. MFAD excels in both simple and complex anomaly detection scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Snippet Anomalous Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16309v1)** | 2023-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a focus on abnormal events contained within untrimmed videos, there is increasing interest among researchers in video anomaly detection. Among different video anomaly detection scenarios, weakly-supervised video anomaly detection poses a significant challenge as it lacks frame-wise labels during the training stage, only relying on video-level labels as coarse supervision. Previous methods have made attempts to either learn discriminative features in an end-to-end manner or employ a twostage self-training strategy to generate snippet-level pseudo labels. However, both approaches have certain limitations. The former tends to overlook informative features at the snippet level, while the latter can be susceptible to noises. In this paper, we propose an Anomalous Attention mechanism for weakly-supervised anomaly detection to tackle the aforementioned problems. Our approach takes into account snippet-level encoded features without the supervision of pseudo labels. Specifically, our approach first generates snippet-level anomalous attention and then feeds it together with original anomaly scores into a Multi-branch Supervision Module. The module learns different areas of the video, including areas that are challenging to detect, and also assists the attention optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets XDViolence and UCF-Crime verify the effectiveness of our method. Besides, thanks to the proposed snippet-level attention, we obtain a more precise anomaly localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Kinematics-inspired Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15662v1)** | 2023-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous approaches to detecting human anomalies in videos have typically relied on implicit modeling by directly applying the model to video or skeleton data, potentially resulting in inaccurate modeling of motion information. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study and introduce a new idea called HKVAD (Human Kinematic-inspired Video Anomaly Detection) for video anomaly detection, which involves the explicit use of human kinematic features to detect anomalies. To validate the effectiveness and potential of this perspective, we propose a pilot method that leverages the kinematic features of the skeleton pose, with a specific focus on the walking stride, skeleton displacement at feet level, and neck level. Following this, the method employs a normalizing flow model to estimate density and detect anomalies based on the estimated density. Based on the number of kinematic features used, we have devised three straightforward variant methods and conducted experiments on two highly challenging public datasets, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal. Our method achieves good results with minimal computational resources, validating its effectiveness and potential.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a system capable to work in an online fashion, giving an immediate response to the arise of anomalies surrounding the AV, exploiting only the videos captured by a dash-mounted camera. Our architecture, called MOVAD, relies on two main modules: a Short-Term Memory Module to extract information related to the ongoing action, implemented by a Video Swin Transformer (VST), and a Long-Term Memory Module injected inside the classifier that considers also remote past information and action context thanks to the use of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The strengths of MOVAD are not only linked to its excellent performance, but also to its straightforward and modular architecture, trained in a end-to-end fashion with only RGB frames with as less assumptions as possible, which makes it easy to implement and play with. We evaluated the performance of our method on Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) dataset, a challenging collection of dash-mounted camera videos of accidents. After an extensive ablation study, MOVAD is able to reach an AUC score of 82.17\%, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by +2.87 AUC.

| **[Reasonable Anomaly Detection in Long Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03401v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a challenging task due to the lack in approaches for representing samples. The visual representations of most existing approaches are limited by short-term sequences of observations which cannot provide enough clues for achieving reasonable detections. In this paper, we propose to completely represent the motion patterns of objects by learning from long-term sequences. Firstly, a Stacked State Machine (SSM) model is proposed to represent the temporal dependencies which are consistent across long-range observations. Then SSM model functions in predicting future states based on past ones, the divergence between the predictions with inherent normal patterns and observed ones determines anomalies which violate normal motion patterns. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach on the dataset and existing ones. Improvements over state-of-the-art methods can be observed.

Existing studies often concentrate solely on features acquired from limited normal data, disregarding the latent prior knowledge present in extensive natural image datasets. To address this constraint, we propose a Prior Knowledge Guided Network(PKG-Net) for the VAD task. First, an auto-encoder network is incorporated into a teacher-student architecture to learn two designated proxy tasks: future frame prediction and teacher network imitation, which can provide better generalization ability on unknown samples. Second, knowledge distillation on proper feature blocks is also proposed to increase the multi-scale detection ability of the model. In addition, prediction error and teacher-student feature inconsistency are combined to evaluate anomaly scores of inference samples more comprehensively. Experimental results on three public benchmarks validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method, which surpasses recent state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Industrial Anomaly Detection with Domain Shift: A Real-world Dataset and Masked Multi-scale Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02216v2)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is crucial for automating industrial quality inspection. The diversity of the datasets is the foundation for developing comprehensive IAD algorithms. Existing IAD datasets focus on the diversity of data categories, overlooking the diversity of domains within the same data category. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two sub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset of blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two characteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different scales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples in the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused by the changes in illumination and view. Based on this dataset, we observe that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) IAD methods exhibit limitations when the domain of normal samples in the test set undergoes a shift. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called masked multi-scale reconstruction (MMR), which enhances the model's capacity to deduce causality among patches in normal samples by a masked reconstruction task. MMR achieves superior performance compared to SOTA methods on the AeBAD dataset. Furthermore, MMR achieves competitive performance with SOTA methods to detect the anomalies of different types on the MVTec AD dataset.

Leading OCC techniques constrain the latent representations of normal motions to limited volumes and detect as abnormal anything outside, which accounts satisfactorily for the openset'ness of anomalies. But normalcy shares the same openset'ness property since humans can perform the same action in several ways, which the leading techniques neglect. We propose a novel generative model for video anomaly detection (VAD), which assumes that both normality and abnormality are multimodal. We consider skeletal representations and leverage state-of-the-art diffusion probabilistic models to generate multimodal future human poses. We contribute a novel conditioning on the past motion of people and exploit the improved mode coverage capabilities of diffusion processes to generate different-but-plausible future motions. Upon the statistical aggregation of future modes, an anomaly is detected when the generated set of motions is not pertinent to the actual future. We validate our model on 4 established benchmarks: UBnormal, HR-UBnormal, HR-STC, and HR-Avenue, with extensive experiments surpassing state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2023 |
| **[TeD-SPAD: Temporal Distinctiveness for Self-supervised Privacy-preservation for video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11072v1)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify unnecessary biases related to people's personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.

| **[Normalizing Flows for Human Pose Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10946v2)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an ill-posed problem because it relies on many parameters such as appearance, pose, camera angle, background, and more. We distill the problem to anomaly detection of human pose, thus decreasing the risk of nuisance parameters such as appearance affecting the result. Focusing on pose alone also has the side benefit of reducing bias against distinct minority groups. Our model works directly on human pose graph sequences and is exceptionally lightweight (~1K parameters), capable of running on any machine able to run the pose estimation with negligible additional resources. We leverage the highly compact pose representation in a normalizing flows framework, which we extend to tackle the unique characteristics of spatio-temporal pose data and show its advantages in this use case. The algorithm is quite general and can handle training data of only normal examples as well as a supervised setting that consists of labeled normal and abnormal examples. We report state-of-the-art results on two anomaly detection benchmarks - the unsupervised ShanghaiTech dataset and the recent supervised UBnormal dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future Video Prediction from a Single Frame for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07783v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important but challenging task in computer vision. The main challenge rises due to the rarity of training samples to model all anomaly cases. Hence, semi-supervised anomaly detection methods have gotten more attention, since they focus on modeling normals and they detect anomalies by measuring the deviations from normal patterns. Despite impressive advances of these methods in modeling normal motion and appearance, long-term motion modeling has not been effectively explored so far. Inspired by the abilities of the future frame prediction proxy-task, we introduce the task of future video prediction from a single frame, as a novel proxy-task for video anomaly detection. This proxy-task alleviates the challenges of previous methods in learning longer motion patterns. Moreover, we replace the initial and future raw frames with their corresponding semantic segmentation map, which not only makes the method aware of object class but also makes the prediction task less complex for the model. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCSD-Ped1, and UCSD-Ped2) show the effectiveness of the method and the superiority of its performance compared to SOTA prediction-based VAD methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing reviews primarily concentrate on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods assuming static cameras. The VAD literature with moving cameras remains fragmented, lacking comprehensive reviews to date. To address this gap, we endeavor to present the first comprehensive survey on Moving Camera Video Anomaly Detection (MC-VAD). We delve into the research papers related to MC-VAD, critically assessing their limitations and highlighting associated challenges. Our exploration encompasses three application domains: security, urban transportation, and marine environments, which in turn cover six specific tasks. We compile an extensive list of 25 publicly-available datasets spanning four distinct environments: underwater, water surface, ground, and aerial. We summarize the types of anomalies these datasets correspond to or contain, and present five main categories of approaches for detecting such anomalies. Lastly, we identify future research directions and discuss novel contributions that could advance the field of MC-VAD. With this survey, we aim to offer a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners striving to develop and advance state-of-the-art MC-VAD methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Learning Causality-inspired Representation Consistency for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01537v1)** | 2023-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging task in the multimedia community, with promising applications in smart cities and secure communities. Existing methods attempt to learn abstract representations of regular events with statistical dependence to model the endogenous normality, which discriminates anomalies by measuring the deviations to the learned distribution. However, conventional representation learning is only a crude description of video normality and lacks an exploration of its underlying causality. The learned statistical dependence is unreliable for diverse regular events in the real world and may cause high false alarms due to overgeneralization. Inspired by causal representation learning, we think that there exists a causal variable capable of adequately representing the general patterns of regular events in which anomalies will present significant variations. Therefore, we design a causality-inspired representation consistency (CRC) framework to implicitly learn the unobservable causal variables of normality directly from available normal videos and detect abnormal events with the learned representation consistency. Extensive experiments show that the causality-inspired normality is robust to regular events with label-independent shifts, and the proposed CRC framework can quickly and accurately detect various complicated anomalies from real-world surveillance videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2023</p></details> |

To accomplish this, the proposed method employs conditional diffusion models, where the input data is the spatiotemporal features extracted from a pre-trained network, and the condition is the features extracted from compact motion representations that summarize a given video segment in terms of its motion and appearance. Our method utilizes a data-driven threshold and considers a high reconstruction error as an indicator of anomalous events. This study is the first to utilize compact motion representations for VAD and the experiments conducted on two large-scale VAD benchmarks demonstrate that they supply relevant information to the diffusion model, and consequently improve VAD performances w.r.t the prior art. Importantly, our method exhibits better generalization performance across different datasets, notably outperforming both the state-of-the-art and baseline methods.

Since certain anomalies cannot be detected by isolated analysis of either temporal or spatial information, the interaction between these two types of data is considered crucial for VAD. However, current dual-stream architectures either confine this integral interaction to the bottleneck of the autoencoder or introduce anomaly-irrelevant background pixels into the interactive process, hindering the accuracy of VAD. To address these deficiencies, we propose a Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Interaction Network (MSTI-Net) for VAD. First, to prioritize the detection of moving objects in the scene and harmonize the substantial semantic discrepancies between the two types of data, we propose an Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Fusion Module (ASTFM) as a substitute for the conventional direct fusion. Furthermore, we inject multi-ASTFM-based connections that bridge the appearance and motion streams of the dual-stream network, thus fostering multi-scale spatial-temporal interaction. Finally, to bolster the delineation between normal and abnormal activities, our system records the regular information in a memory module. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves AUCs of 96.8%, 87.6%, and 73.9% on the UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first propose to utilize the ViT-encoded visual features from CLIP, in contrast with the conventional C3D or I3D features in the domain, to efficiently extract discriminative representations in the novel technique. We then model temporal dependencies and nominate the snippets of interest by leveraging our proposed Temporal Self-Attention (TSA). The ablation study confirms the effectiveness of TSA and ViT feature.

Currently, most video anomaly detection methods are based on RGB modality, but its redundant semantic information may breach the privacy of residents or patients. The 3D data obtained by depth camera and LiDAR can accurately locate anomalous events in 3D space while preserving human posture and motion information. Identifying individuals through the point cloud is difficult due to its sparsity, which protects personal privacy. In this study, we propose Point Spatio-Temporal Auto-Encoder (PSTAE), an autoencoder framework that uses point cloud videos as input to detect anomalies in point cloud videos. We introduce PSTOp and PSTTransOp to maintain spatial geometric and temporal motion information in point cloud videos. To measure the reconstruction loss of the proposed autoencoder framework, we propose a reconstruction loss measurement strategy based on a shallow feature extractor. Experimental results on the TIMo dataset show that our method outperforms currently representative depth modality-based methods in terms of AUROC and has superior performance in detecting Medical Issue anomalies. These results suggest the potential of point cloud modality in video anomaly detection. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the TIMo dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHAD: Charlotte Anomaly Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09258v3)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, we have seen a significant interest in data-driven deep learning approaches for video anomaly detection, where an algorithm must determine if specific frames of a video contain abnormal behaviors. However, video anomaly detection is particularly context-specific, and the availability of representative datasets heavily limits real-world accuracy. Additionally, the metrics currently reported by most state-of-the-art methods often do not reflect how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. In this article, we present the Charlotte Anomaly Dataset (CHAD). CHAD is a high-resolution, multi-camera anomaly dataset in a commercial parking lot setting. In addition to frame-level anomaly labels, CHAD is the first anomaly dataset to include bounding box, identity, and pose annotations for each actor. This is especially beneficial for skeleton-based anomaly detection, which is useful for its lower computational demand in real-world settings. CHAD is also the first anomaly dataset to contain multiple views of the same scene. With four camera views and over 1.15 million frames, CHAD is the largest fully annotated anomaly detection dataset including person annotations, collected from continuous video streams from stationary cameras for smart video surveillance applications. To demonstrate the efficacy of CHAD for training and evaluation, we benchmark two state-of-the-art skeleton-based anomaly detection algorithms on CHAD and provide comprehensive analysis, including both quantitative results and qualitative examination. The dataset is available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/CHAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Comprehensive Benchmark for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13611v1)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical task in the intelligent surveillance system. However, an essential type of anomaly in VAD named scene-dependent anomaly has not received the attention of researchers. Moreover, there is no research investigating anomaly anticipation, a more significant task for preventing the occurrence of anomalous events. To this end, we propose a new comprehensive dataset, NWPU Campus, containing 43 scenes, 28 classes of abnormal events, and 16 hours of videos. At present, it is the largest semi-supervised VAD dataset with the largest number of scenes and classes of anomalies, the longest duration, and the only one considering the scene-dependent anomaly. Meanwhile, it is also the first dataset proposed for video anomaly anticipation. We further propose a novel model capable of detecting and anticipating anomalous events simultaneously. Compared with 7 outstanding VAD algorithms in recent years, our method can cope with scene-dependent anomaly detection and anomaly anticipation both well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech, CUHK Avenue, IITB Corridor and the newly proposed NWPU Campus datasets consistently. Our dataset and code is available at: https://campusvad.github.io.</p></details> | CVPR 2023 |

Due to the inherent rarity and heterogeneity of abnormal events, the problem is viewed as a normality modeling strategy, in which our model learns object-centric normal patterns without seeing anomalous samples during training. The main contributions consist in coupling pretrained object-level action features prototypes with a cosine distance-based anomaly estimation function, therefore extending previous methods by introducing additional constraints to the mainstream reconstruction-based strategy. Our framework leverages both appearance and motion information to learn object-level behavior and captures prototypical patterns within a memory module. Experiments on several well-known datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as it outperforms current state-of-the-art on most relevant spatio-temporal evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICIP 2022</p></details> |

| **[Understanding Long Videos via LLM-Powered Entity Relation Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15953v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of extended video content poses unique challenges in artificial intelligence, particularly when dealing with the complexity of tracking and understanding visual elements across time. Current methodologies that process video frames sequentially struggle to maintain coherent tracking of objects, especially when these objects temporarily vanish and later reappear in the footage. A critical limitation of these approaches is their inability to effectively identify crucial moments in the video, largely due to their limited grasp of temporal relationships. To overcome these obstacles, we present GraphVideoAgent, a cutting-edge system that leverages the power of graph-based object tracking in conjunction with large language model capabilities. At its core, our framework employs a dynamic graph structure that maps and monitors the evolving relationships between visual entities throughout the video sequence. This innovative approach enables more nuanced understanding of how objects interact and transform over time, facilitating improved frame selection through comprehensive contextual awareness. Our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness when tested against industry benchmarks. In evaluations on the EgoSchema dataset, GraphVideoAgent achieved a 2.2 improvement over existing methods while requiring analysis of only 8.2 frames on average. Similarly, testing on the NExT-QA benchmark yielded a 2.0 performance increase with an average frame requirement of 8.1. These results underscore the efficiency of our graph-guided methodology in enhancing both accuracy and computational performance in long-form video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

While recent omni models can process multiple modalities, they generally lack effectiveness in human-centric scenes due to the absence of large-scale, specialized datasets and non-targeted architectures. In this work, we developed HumanOmni, the industry's first human-centric Omni-multimodal large language model. We constructed a dataset containing over 2.4 million human-centric video clips with detailed captions and more than 14 million instructions, facilitating the understanding of diverse human-centric scenes. HumanOmni includes three specialized branches for understanding different types of scenes. It adaptively fuses features from these branches based on user instructions, significantly enhancing visual understanding in scenes centered around individuals. Moreover, HumanOmni integrates audio features to ensure a comprehensive understanding of environments and individuals. Our experiments validate HumanOmni's advanced capabilities in handling human-centric scenes across a variety of tasks, including emotion recognition, facial expression description, and action understanding. Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</p></details> |  |

Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8% over GPT-4o and 5.8% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

| **[VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13106v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current video understanding models struggle with processing long video sequences, supporting multi-turn dialogues, and adapting to real-world dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose StreamChat, a training-free framework for streaming video reasoning and conversational interaction. $\StreamChat$ leverages a novel hierarchical memory system to efficiently process and compress video features over extended sequences, enabling real-time, multi-turn dialogue. Our framework incorporates a parallel system scheduling strategy that enhances processing speed and reduces latency, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications. Furthermore, we introduce StreamBench, a versatile benchmark that evaluates streaming video understanding across diverse media types and interactive scenarios, including multi-turn interactions and complex reasoning tasks. Extensive evaluations on StreamBench and other public benchmarks demonstrate that StreamChat significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and response times, confirming its effectiveness for streaming video understanding.

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

MMVU includes 3,000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared to prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example is annotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example is enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latest System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest performance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matching human expertise. Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, we offer actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level, knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data.

This problem is called monocular visual odometry and often relies on geometric approaches that require considerable engineering effort for a specific scenario. Deep learning methods have been shown to be generalizable after proper training and with a large amount of available data. Transformer-based architectures have dominated the state-of-the-art in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, such as image and video understanding. In this work, we deal with the monocular visual odometry as a video understanding task to estimate the 6 degrees of freedom of a camera's pose. We contribute by presenting the TSformer-VO model based on spatio-temporal self-attention mechanisms to extract features from clips and estimate the motions in an end-to-end manner. Our approach achieved competitive state-of-the-art performance compared with geometry-based and deep learning-based methods on the KITTI visual odometry dataset, outperforming the DeepVO implementation highly accepted in the visual odometry community.

| **[Neptune: The Long Orbit to Benchmarking Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09582v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Neptune, a benchmark for long video understanding that requires reasoning over long time horizons and across different modalities. Many existing video datasets and models are focused on short clips (10s-30s). While some long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image models applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are usually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these problems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large models (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video captions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to 15 minutes in length). Our dataset Neptune covers a broad range of long video reasoning abilities and consists of a subset that emphasizes multimodal reasoning. Since existing metrics for open-ended question answering are either rule-based or may rely on proprietary models, we provide a new open source model-based metric GEM to score open-ended responses on Neptune. Benchmark evaluations reveal that most current open-source long video models perform poorly on Neptune, particularly on questions testing temporal ordering, counting and state changes. Through Neptune, we aim to spur the development of more advanced models capable of understanding long videos. The dataset is available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping. Built from 3.4K original videos-expanded to over 17K tampered clips spanning 19 video tasks. MVTamperBench challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families, revealing substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and showing that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms.

However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI Submission. continuous work of arXiv:2409.17647 (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Recently, the emergence of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown promise in general video understanding tasks. However, describing facial expressions within videos poses two major challenges for these models: (1) the lack of adequate datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the limited visual token capacity of video MLLMs. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new instruction-following dataset tailored for dynamic facial expression caption. The dataset comprises 5,033 high-quality video clips annotated manually, containing over 700,000 tokens. Its purpose is to improve the capability of video MLLMs to discern subtle facial nuances. Furthermore, we propose FaceTrack-MM, which leverages a limited number of tokens to encode the main character's face. This model demonstrates superior performance in tracking faces and focusing on the facial expressions of the main characters, even in intricate multi-person scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric combining event extraction, relation classification, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to assess the content consistency and temporal sequence consistency of generated text. Moreover, we present FEC-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of existing video MLLMs in this specific task.

While Transformer-based methods have shown promise, their handling of long-range dependencies struggles due to quadratic computational costs, presenting a bottleneck in complex scenarios. To overcome this limitation and facilitate complex multi-modal comprehension with linear complexity, we introduce AVS-Mamba, a selective state space model to address the AVS task. Our framework incorporates two key components for video understanding and cross-modal learning: Temporal Mamba Block for sequential video processing and Vision-to-Audio Fusion Block for advanced audio-vision integration. Building on this, we develop the Multi-scale Temporal Encoder, aimed at enhancing the learning of visual features across scales, facilitating the perception of intra- and inter-frame information. To perform multi-modal fusion, we propose the Modality Aggregation Decoder, leveraging the Vision-to-Audio Fusion Block to integrate visual features into audio features across both frame and temporal levels. Further, we adopt the Contextual Integration Pyramid to perform audio-to-vision spatial-temporal context collaboration.

Although effective, existing graph-based approaches focus on capturing the human-object relationships while ignoring fine-grained semantic properties of the action components. These semantic properties are crucial for understanding the current situation, such as where does the action takes place, what tools are used and functional properties of the objects. In this work, we propose a graph-based representation called Situational Scene Graph (SSG) to encode both human-object relationships and the corresponding semantic properties. The semantic details are represented as predefined roles and values inspired by situation frame, which is originally designed to represent a single action. Based on our proposed representation, we introduce the task of situational scene graph generation and propose a multi-stage pipeline Interactive and Complementary Network (InComNet) to address the task. Given that the existing datasets are not applicable to the task, we further introduce a SSG dataset whose annotations consist of semantic role-value frames for human, objects and verb predicates of human-object relations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSG representation by testing on different downstream tasks. Experimental results show that the unified representation can not only benefit predicate classification and semantic role-value classification, but also benefit reasoning tasks on human-centric situation understanding. We will release the code and the dataset soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video Quality Assessment for Online Processing: From Spatial to Temporal Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07087v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of multimedia processing and deep learning technologies, especially in the field of video understanding, video quality assessment (VQA) has achieved significant progress. Although researchers have moved from designing efficient video quality mapping models to various research directions, in-depth exploration of the effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs of spatio-temporal modeling in VQA models is still less sufficient. Considering the fact that videos have highly redundant information, this paper investigates this problem from the perspective of joint spatial and temporal sampling, aiming to seek the answer to how little information we should keep at least when feeding videos into the VQA models while with acceptable performance sacrifice. To this end, we drastically sample the video's information from both spatial and temporal dimensions, and the heavily squeezed video is then fed into a stable VQA model. Comprehensive experiments regarding joint spatial and temporal sampling are conducted on six public video quality databases, and the results demonstrate the acceptable performance of the VQA model when throwing away most of the video information. Furthermore, with the proposed joint spatial and temporal sampling strategy, we make an initial attempt to design an online VQA model, which is instantiated by as simple as possible a spatial feature extractor, a temporal feature fusion module, and a global quality regression module. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we verify the feasibility of online VQA model by simplifying itself and reducing input.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Valley2, a novel multimodal large language model designed to enhance performance across all domains and extend the boundaries of practical applications in e-commerce and short video scenarios. Notably, Valley2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on e-commerce benchmarks, surpassing open-source models of similar size by a large margin (79.66 vs. 72.76). Additionally, Valley2 ranks second on the OpenCompass leaderboard among models with fewer than 10B parameters, with an impressive average score of 67.4. The code and model weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/Valley.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-LeBench: A Benchmark for Extremely Long Egocentric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06835v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form egocentric video understanding provides rich contextual information and unique insights into long-term human behaviors, holding significant potential for applications in embodied intelligence, long-term activity analysis, and personalized assistive technologies. However, existing benchmark datasets primarily focus on single, short-duration videos or moderately long videos up to dozens of minutes, leaving a substantial gap in evaluating extensive, ultra-long egocentric video recordings. To address this, we introduce X-LeBench, a novel benchmark dataset specifically crafted for evaluating tasks on extremely long egocentric video recordings. Leveraging the advanced text processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), X-LeBench develops a life-logging simulation pipeline that produces realistic, coherent daily plans aligned with real-world video data. This approach enables the flexible integration of synthetic daily plans with real-world footage from Ego4D-a massive-scale egocentric video dataset covers a wide range of daily life scenarios-resulting in 432 simulated video life logs that mirror realistic daily activities in contextually rich scenarios. The video life-log durations span from 23 minutes to 16.4 hours. The evaluation of several baseline systems and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveals their poor performance across the board, highlighting the inherent challenges of long-form egocentric video understanding and underscoring the need for more advanced models.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidChain: Chain-of-Tasks with Metric-based Direct Preference Optimization for Dense Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06761v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advancements of Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) in various tasks, they struggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, such as Dense Video Captioning (DVC). DVC is a complicated task of describing all events within a video while also temporally localizing them, which integrates multiple fine-grained tasks, including video segmentation, video captioning, and temporal video grounding. Previous VideoLLMs attempt to solve DVC in a single step, failing to utilize their reasoning capability. Moreover, previous training objectives for VideoLLMs do not fully reflect the evaluation metrics, therefore not providing supervision directly aligned to target tasks. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework named VidChain comprised of Chain-of-Tasks (CoTasks) and Metric-based Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO). CoTasks decompose a complex task into a sequence of sub-tasks, allowing VideoLLMs to leverage their reasoning capabilities more effectively. M-DPO aligns a VideoLLM with evaluation metrics, providing fine-grained supervision to each task that is well-aligned with metrics. Applied to two different VideoLLMs, VidChain consistently improves their fine-grained video understanding, thereby outperforming previous VideoLLMs on two different DVC benchmarks and also on the temporal video grounding task. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/mlvlab/VidChain}.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Yet, outside of specific tasks that require explicit temporal understanding, static image pretraining remains the dominant paradigm for learning visual foundation models. We question this mismatch, and ask whether video pretraining can yield visual representations that bear the hallmarks of human perception: generalisation across tasks, robustness to perturbations, and consistency with human judgements. To that end we propose a novel procedure for curating videos, and develop a contrastive framework which learns from the complex transformations therein. This simple paradigm for distilling knowledge from videos, called VITO, yields general representations that far outperform prior video pretraining methods on image understanding tasks, and image pretraining methods on video understanding tasks. Moreover, VITO representations are significantly more robust to natural and synthetic deformations than image-, video-, and adversarially-trained ones. Finally, VITO's predictions are strongly aligned with human judgements, surpassing models that were specifically trained for that purpose. Together, these results suggest that video pretraining could be a simple way of learning unified, robust, and human-aligned representations of the visual world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Long Story Short: Story-level Video Understanding from 20K Short Films](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10221v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in vision-language models have significantly advanced video understanding. Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often depict activities of one person in a single scene. Although existing movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos, and frequently encounter data leakage issues given the use of subtitles and other information about commercial movies during LLM pretraining. To address the above limitations, we propose Short-Films 20K (SF20K), the largest publicly available movie dataset. SF20K is composed of 20,143 amateur films and offers long-term video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive analysis of SF20K reveals minimal data leakage, emphasizes the need for long-term reasoning, and demonstrates the strong performance of recent VLMs. Finally, we show that instruction tuning on the SF20K-Train set substantially improves model performance, paving the way for future progress in long-term video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Shark Tracking and Biometrics from Aerial Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05717v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent widespread adoption of drones for studying marine animals provides opportunities for deriving biological information from aerial imagery. The large scale of imagery data acquired from drones is well suited for machine learning (ML) analysis. Development of ML models for analyzing marine animal aerial imagery has followed the classical paradigm of training, testing, and deploying a new model for each dataset, requiring significant time, human effort, and ML expertise. We introduce Frame Level ALIgment and tRacking (FLAIR), which leverages the video understanding of Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and the vision-language capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). FLAIR takes a drone video as input and outputs segmentation masks of the species of interest across the video. Notably, FLAIR leverages a zero-shot approach, eliminating the need for labeled data, training a new model, or fine-tuning an existing model to generalize to other species. With a dataset of 18,000 drone images of Pacific nurse sharks, we trained state-of-the-art object detection models to compare against FLAIR. We show that FLAIR massively outperforms these object detectors and performs competitively against two human-in-the-loop methods for prompting SAM2, achieving a Dice score of 0.81. FLAIR readily generalizes to other shark species without additional human effort and can be combined with novel heuristics to automatically extract relevant information including length and tailbeat frequency. FLAIR has significant potential to accelerate aerial imagery analysis workflows, requiring markedly less human effort and expertise than traditional machine learning workflows, while achieving superior accuracy. By reducing the effort required for aerial imagery analysis, FLAIR allows scientists to spend more time interpreting results and deriving insights about marine ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From My View to Yours: Ego-Augmented Learning in Large Vision Language Models for Understanding Exocentric Daily Living Activities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05711v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video understanding, yet their adoption for Activities of Daily Living (ADL) remains limited by their inability to capture fine-grained interactions and spatial relationships. This limitation is particularly evident in ADL tasks, where understanding detailed human-object interaction and human-centric motion is crucial for applications such as elderly monitoring and cognitive assessment. To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose an online ego2exo distillation approach to learn ego-augmented exo representations in LVLMs. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo training data, which is impractical to collect for real-world ADL scenarios. Consequently, we develop EgoMimic, a skeleton-guided method that can generate mimicked ego views from exocentric videos. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed EgoPerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos. Code, models, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/dominickrei/EgoExo4ADL.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVO-Bench: How Far is Your Video-LLMs from Real-World Online Video Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05510v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static, post hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/OVO-Bench.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Differentiable Task Graph Learning: Procedural Activity Representation and Online Mistake Detection from Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01486v3)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Procedural activities are sequences of key-steps aimed at achieving specific goals. They are crucial to build intelligent agents able to assist users effectively. In this context, task graphs have emerged as a human-understandable representation of procedural activities, encoding a partial ordering over the key-steps. While previous works generally relied on hand-crafted procedures to extract task graphs from videos, in this paper, we propose an approach based on direct maximum likelihood optimization of edges' weights, which allows gradient-based learning of task graphs and can be naturally plugged into neural network architectures. Experiments on the CaptainCook4D dataset demonstrate the ability of our approach to predict accurate task graphs from the observation of action sequences, with an improvement of +16.7% over previous approaches. Owing to the differentiability of the proposed framework, we also introduce a feature-based approach, aiming to predict task graphs from key-step textual or video embeddings, for which we observe emerging video understanding abilities. Task graphs learned with our approach are also shown to significantly enhance online mistake detection in procedural egocentric videos, achieving notable gains of +19.8% and +7.5% on the Assembly101-O and EPIC-Tent-O datasets. Code for replicating experiments is available at https://github.com/fpv-iplab/Differentiable-Task-Graph-Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-Octopus: Unlocking Instruction-Driven Adaptive Projector Fusion for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05067v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Octopus, a novel video multimodal large language model. LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as multimodal understanding, visual question answering, and video understanding, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongViTU: Instruction Tuning for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05037v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduce LongViTU, a large-scale (~121k QA pairs, ~900h videos), automatically generated dataset for long-form video understanding. We developed a systematic approach that organizes videos into a hierarchical tree structure and incorporates self-revision mechanisms to ensure high-quality QA pairs. Each QA pair in LongViTU features: 1) long-term context (average certificate length of 4.6 minutes); 2) rich knowledge and condensed reasoning (commonsense, causality, planning, etc.); and 3) explicit timestamp labels for relevant events. LongViTU also serves as a benchmark for instruction following in long-form and streaming video understanding. We evaluate the open-source state-of-the-art long video understanding model, LongVU, and the commercial model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, on our benchmark. They achieve GPT-4 scores of 49.9 and 52.3, respectively, underscoring the substantial challenge posed by our benchmark. Further supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on LongVU led to performance improvements of 12.0% on our benchmark, 2.2% on the in-distribution (ID) benchmark EgoSchema, 1.0%, 2.2% and 1.2% on the out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks VideoMME (Long), WorldQA and OpenEQA, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate LongViTU's high data quality and robust OOD generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation. The code and demo will be made public.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://embodied-videoagent.github.io/</p></details> |

However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, technical report</p></details> |
| **[Building a Mind Palace: Structuring Environment-Grounded Semantic Graphs for Effective Long Video Analysis with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04336v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding with Large Vision Language Models is challenged by the need to analyze temporally dispersed yet spatially concentrated key moments within limited context windows. In this work, we introduce VideoMindPalace, a new framework inspired by the "Mind Palace", which organizes critical video moments into a topologically structured semantic graph. VideoMindPalace organizes key information through (i) hand-object tracking and interaction, (ii) clustered activity zones representing specific areas of recurring activities, and (iii) environment layout mapping, allowing natural language parsing by LLMs to provide grounded insights on spatio-temporal and 3D context. In addition, we propose the Video MindPalace Benchmark (VMB), to assess human-like reasoning, including spatial localization, temporal reasoning, and layout-aware sequential understanding. Evaluated on VMB and established video QA datasets, including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA, and the Active Memories Benchmark, VideoMindPalace demonstrates notable gains in spatio-temporal coherence and human-aligned reasoning, advancing long-form video analysis capabilities in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-MBA: Hierarchical MamBa Adaptation for Multi-Modal Video Understanding in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04302v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs), autonomous driving has encountered new opportunities and challenges. In particular, multi-modal video understanding is critical to interactively analyze what will happen in the procedure of autonomous driving. However, videos in such a dynamical scene that often contains complex spatial-temporal movements, which restricts the generalization capacity of the existing MLLMs in this field. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Mamba Adaptation (H-MBA) framework to fit the complicated motion changes in autonomous driving videos. Specifically, our H-MBA consists of two distinct modules, including Context Mamba (C-Mamba) and Query Mamba (Q-Mamba). First, C-Mamba contains various types of structure state space models, which can effectively capture multi-granularity video context for different temporal resolutions. Second, Q-Mamba flexibly transforms the current frame as the learnable query, and attentively selects multi-granularity video context into query. Consequently, it can adaptively integrate all the video contexts of multi-scale temporal resolutions to enhance video understanding. Via a plug-and-play paradigm in MLLMs, our H-MBA shows the remarkable performance on multi-modal video tasks in autonomous driving, e.g., for risk object detection, it outperforms the previous SOTA method with 5.5% mIoU improvement.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MotionBench: Benchmarking and Improving Fine-grained Video Motion Understanding for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02955v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision language models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in video understanding. However, a crucial capability - fine-grained motion comprehension - remains under-explored in current benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose MotionBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained motion comprehension of video understanding models. MotionBench evaluates models' motion-level perception through six primary categories of motion-oriented question types and includes data collected from diverse sources, ensuring a broad representation of real-world video content. Experimental results reveal that existing VLMs perform poorly in understanding fine-grained motions. To enhance VLM's ability to perceive fine-grained motion within a limited sequence length of LLM, we conduct extensive experiments reviewing VLM architectures optimized for video feature compression and propose a novel and efficient Through-Encoder (TE) Fusion method. Experiments show that higher frame rate inputs and TE Fusion yield improvements in motion understanding, yet there is still substantial room for enhancement. Our benchmark aims to guide and motivate the development of more capable video understanding models, emphasizing the importance of fine-grained motion comprehension.

| **[ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504v2)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

However, evaluating these video models presents its own unique challenges, for which several benchmarks have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the currently most used video-language benchmarks can be solved without requiring much temporal reasoning. We identified three main issues in existing datasets: (i) static information from single frames is often sufficient to solve the tasks (ii) the text of the questions and candidate answers is overly informative, allowing models to answer correctly without relying on any visual input (iii) world knowledge alone can answer many of the questions, making the benchmarks a test of knowledge replication rather than visual reasoning. In addition, we found that open-ended question-answering benchmarks for video understanding suffer from similar issues while the automatic evaluation process with LLMs is unreliable, making it an unsuitable alternative. As a solution, we propose TVBench, a novel open-source video multiple-choice question-answering benchmark, and demonstrate through extensive evaluations that it requires a high level of temporal understanding. Surprisingly, we find that most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform similarly to random performance on TVBench, with only a few models such as Qwen2-VL, and Tarsier clearly surpassing this baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. Among them, in this paper, we focus on building a large-scale hour-long long video benchmark, HLV-1K, designed to evaluate long video understanding models. HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks. This includes promoting future long video understanding tasks at a granular level, such as deep understanding of long live videos, meeting recordings, and movies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Specialized Visual Encoders for Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01426v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tylerzhu.com/merv/</p></details> |
| **[MLVU: Benchmarking Multi-task Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04264v3)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of Long Video Understanding (LVU) performance poses an important but challenging research problem. Despite previous efforts, the existing video understanding benchmarks are severely constrained by several issues, especially the insufficient lengths of videos, a lack of diversity in video types and evaluation tasks, and the inappropriateness for evaluating LVU performances. To address the above problems, we propose a new benchmark called MLVU (Multi-task Long Video Understanding Benchmark) for the comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of LVU. MLVU presents the following critical values: \textit{1)} The substantial and flexible extension of video lengths, which enables the benchmark to evaluate LVU performance across a wide range of durations. \textit{2)} The inclusion of various video genres, e.g., movies, surveillance footage, egocentric videos, cartoons, game videos, etc., which reflects the models' LVU performances in different scenarios. \textit{3)} The development of diversified evaluation tasks, which enables a comprehensive examination of MLLMs' key abilities in long-video understanding. The empirical study with 23 latest MLLMs reveals significant room for improvement in today's technique, as all existing methods struggle with most of the evaluation tasks and exhibit severe performance degradation when handling longer videos. Additionally, it suggests that factors such as context length, image-understanding ability, and the choice of LLM backbone can play critical roles in future advancements. We anticipate that MLVU will advance the research of long video understanding by providing a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features six core task types across three temporal contexts-past, present, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy.</p></details> |  |

Traditional activity recognition systems are limited by fixed vocabularies, predefined labels, and rigid interaction categories that often rely on choreographed videos and overlook concurrent interactive groups. These limitations make such systems less adaptable to real-world scenarios, where interactions are diverse and unpredictable. In this paper, we propose an open vocabulary human-to-human interaction recognition (OV-HHIR) framework that leverages large language models to generate open-ended textual descriptions of both seen and unseen human interactions in open-world settings without being confined to a fixed vocabulary. Additionally, we create a comprehensive, large-scale human-to-human interaction dataset by standardizing and combining existing public human interaction datasets into a unified benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional fixed-vocabulary classification systems and existing cross-modal language models for video understanding, setting the stage for more intelligent and adaptable visual understanding systems in surveillance and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detection-Fusion for Knowledge Graph Extraction from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00136v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenging tasks in the field of video understanding is extracting semantic content from video inputs. Most existing systems use language models to describe videos in natural language sentences, but this has several major shortcomings. Such systems can rely too heavily on the language model component and base their output on statistical regularities in natural language text rather than on the visual contents of the video. Additionally, natural language annotations cannot be readily processed by a computer, are difficult to evaluate with performance metrics and cannot be easily translated into a different natural language. In this paper, we propose a method to annotate videos with knowledge graphs, and so avoid these problems. Specifically, we propose a deep-learning-based model for this task that first predicts pairs of individuals and then the relations between them. Additionally, we propose an extension of our model for the inclusion of background knowledge in the construction of knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, To be submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Existing token reduction methods primarily focus on importance-based token pruning, which overlooks the redundancy caused by frame resemblance and repetitive visual elements. In this paper, we analyze the high vision token similarities in LVLMs. We reveal that token similarity distribution condenses as layers deepen while maintaining ranking consistency. Leveraging the unique properties of similarity over importance, we introduce FrameFusion, a novel approach that combines similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning for better token reduction in LVLMs. FrameFusion identifies and merges similar tokens before pruning, opening up a new perspective for token reduction. We evaluate FrameFusion on diverse LVLMs, including Llava-Video-{7B,32B,72B}, and MiniCPM-V-8B, on video understanding, question-answering, and retrieval benchmarks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces vision tokens by 70$\%$, achieving 3.4-4.4x LLM speedups and 1.6-1.9x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3$\%$.

VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal fusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention and mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and fusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive learning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and a novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS. We evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of lectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in boosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese lecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further research in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to competitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize object and action recognition, often neglecting the intricate nuances of human emotions, behaviors, and speech visual alignment within video content. We present HumanVBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to bridge these gaps in the evaluation of video MLLMs. HumanVBench comprises 17 carefully designed tasks that explore two primary dimensions: inner emotion and outer manifestations, spanning static and dynamic, basic and complex, as well as single-modal and cross-modal aspects. With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 16 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and temporal alignment, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding. HumanVBench is open-sourced to facilitate future advancements and real-world applications in video MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 24 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Although existing models perform well in the factoid VideoQA task, they still face challenges in deep video understanding (DVU) task, which focuses on story videos. Compared to factoid videos, the most significant feature of story videos is storylines, which are composed of complex interactions and long-range evolvement of core story topics including characters, actions and locations. Understanding these topics requires models to possess DVU capability. However, existing DVU datasets rarely organize questions according to these story topics, making them difficult to comprehensively assess VideoQA models' DVU capability of complex storylines. Additionally, the question quantity and video length of these dataset are limited by high labor costs of handcrafted dataset building method. In this paper, we devise a large language model based multi-agent collaboration framework, StoryMind, to automatically generate a new large-scale DVU dataset. The dataset, FriendsQA, derived from the renowned sitcom Friends with an average episode length of 1,358 seconds, contains 44.6K questions evenly distributed across 14 fine-grained topics. Finally, We conduct comprehensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art VideoQA models using the FriendsQA dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

It spurs the need to continually adapt to various users and scenes. Fine-tuning current video understanding models on newly encountered domains often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the models lose their ability to perform well on previously learned scenarios. To address this issue, we formalize the problem of Video Domain Incremental Learning (VDIL), which enables models to learn continually from different domains while maintaining a fixed set of action classes. Existing continual learning research primarily focuses on class-incremental learning, while the domain incremental learning has been largely overlooked in video understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark of domain incremental human action recognition for unconstrained home environments. We design three domain split types (user, scene, hybrid) to systematically assess the challenges posed by domain shifts in real-world home settings. Furthermore, we propose a baseline learning strategy based on replay and reservoir sampling techniques without domain labels to handle scenarios with limited memory and task agnosticism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our simple sampling and replay strategy outperforms most existing continual learning methods across the three proposed benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in video tasks due to their extended capabilities in comprehending visual modalities. However, the substantial redundancy in video data presents significant computational challenges for LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a training-free method that 1) minimizes video redundancy by merging spatial-temporal tokens, and 2) leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to selectively prune visual features relevant to question tokens, enhancing model efficiency. We validate our method across multiple video benchmarks, which demonstrate that PruneVid can prune over 80% of tokens while maintaining competitive performance combined with different model networks. This highlights its superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing pruning methods.

This becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable (i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual question-answering benchmarks including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and NExT-GQA, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale.

To address this problem, fine-tuning long-context LVLMs and employing GPT-based agents have emerged as promising solutions. However, fine-tuning LVLMs would require extensive high-quality data and substantial GPU resources, while GPT-based agents would rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this paper, we propose Video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Video-RAG), a training-free and cost-effective pipeline that employs visually-aligned auxiliary texts to help facilitate cross-modality alignment while providing additional information beyond the visual content. Specifically, we leverage open-source external tools to extract visually-aligned information from pure video data (e.g., audio, optical character, and object detection), and incorporate the extracted information into an existing LVLM as auxiliary texts, alongside video frames and queries, in a plug-and-play manner. Our Video-RAG offers several key advantages: (i) lightweight with low computing overhead due to single-turn retrieval; (ii) easy implementation and compatibility with any LVLM; and (iii) significant, consistent performance gains across long video understanding benchmarks, including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench. Notably, our model demonstrates superior performance over proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o when utilized with a 72B model.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, they suffer from two major limitations; first, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits the number of tokens that can be processed, and second, Transformers often require large amounts of training data to attain state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a new multi-head self-attention (MHSA) variant named Fibottention, which can replace MHSA in Transformer architectures. Fibottention is data-efficient and computationally more suitable for processing large numbers of tokens than the standard MHSA. It employs structured sparse attention based on dilated Fibonacci sequences, which, uniquely, differ across attention heads, resulting in inception-like diverse features across heads. The spacing of the Fibonacci sequences follows the Wythoff array, which minimizes the redundancy of token interactions aggregated across different attention heads, while still capturing sufficient complementary information through token pair interactions. These sparse attention patterns are unique among the existing sparse attention and lead to an $O(N \log N)$ complexity, where $N$ is the number of tokens. Leveraging only 2-6% of the elements in the self-attention heads, Fibottention embedded into popular, state-of-the-art Transformer architectures can achieve significantly improved predictive performance for domains with limited data such as image classification, video understanding, and robot learning tasks, and render reduced computational complexity. We further validated the improved diversity of feature representations resulting from different self-attention heads, and our model design against other sparse attention mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The complete implementation, including source code and evaluation scripts, is publicly available at: https://github.com/Charlotte-CharMLab/Fibottention</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Contrastive Learning for Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07157v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal grounding, which localizes video moments related to a natural language query, is a core problem of vision-language learning and video understanding. To encode video moments of varying lengths, recent methods employ a multi-level structure known as a feature pyramid. In this structure, lower levels concentrate on short-range video moments, while higher levels address long-range moments. Because higher levels experience downsampling to accommodate increasing moment length, their capacity to capture information is reduced and consequently leads to degraded information in moment representations. To resolve this problem, we propose a contrastive learning framework to capture salient semantics among video moments. Our key methodology is to leverage samples from the feature space emanating from multiple stages of the video encoder itself requiring neither data augmentation nor online memory banks to obtain positive and negative samples. To enable such an extension, we introduce a sampling process to draw multiple video moments corresponding to a common query. Subsequently, by utilizing these moments' representations across video encoder layers, we instantiate a novel form of multi-scale and cross-scale contrastive learning that links local short-range video moments with global long-range video moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for not only long-form but also short-form video grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods are often developed separately for specific domains, overlooking the similarities in task settings and solutions across these two areas. In this paper, we define the union of referring segmentation and reasoning segmentation at both the image and video levels as Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS). Correspondingly, we propose InstructSeg, an end-to-end segmentation pipeline equipped with MLLMs for IVS. Specifically, we employ an object-aware video perceiver to extract temporal and object information from reference frames, facilitating comprehensive video understanding. Additionally, we introduce vision-guided multi-granularity text fusion to better integrate global and detailed text information with fine-grained visual guidance. By leveraging multi-task and end-to-end training, InstructSeg demonstrates superior performance across diverse image and video segmentation tasks, surpassing both segmentation specialists and MLLM-based methods with a single model.

| **[Do Language Models Understand Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.</p></details> | Research report |

Meanwhile, a smaller body of work addresses dense, pixel-precise segmentation tasks, which typically involve category-guided or referral-based object segmentation. Although both research directions are essential for developing models with human-level video comprehension, they have largely evolved separately, with distinct benchmarks and architectures. This paper aims to unify these efforts by introducing ViCaS, a new dataset containing thousands of challenging videos, each annotated with detailed, human-written captions and temporally consistent, pixel-accurate masks for multiple objects with phrase grounding. Our benchmark evaluates models on both holistic/high-level understanding and language-guided, pixel-precise segmentation. We also present carefully validated evaluation measures and propose an effective model architecture that can tackle our benchmark.

However, visual information lacking of guidance from the user's intention may lead to redundant computation and involve unnecessary visual noise, especially in long, untrimmed videos. To address this issue, we propose FocusChat, a text-guided multi-modal large language model (LLM) that emphasizes visual information correlated to the user's prompt. In detail, Our model first undergoes the semantic extraction module, which comprises a visual semantic branch and a text semantic branch to extract image and text semantics, respectively. The two branches are combined using the Spatial-Temporal Filtering Module (STFM). STFM enables explicit spatial-level information filtering and implicit temporal-level feature filtering, ensuring that the visual tokens are closely aligned with the user's query. It lowers the essential number of visual tokens inputted into the LLM. FocusChat significantly outperforms Video-LLaMA in zero-shot experiments, using an order of magnitude less training data with only 16 visual tokens occupied. It achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in few-shot experiments, with only 0.72M pre-training data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, many applications require higher precision at the frame level. In this work, we propose a novel task, BestShot, which aims to locate highlight frames within human-centric videos via language queries. This task demands not only a deep semantic comprehension of human actions but also precise temporal localization. To support this task, we introduce the BestShot Benchmark. %The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human detection and tracking, potential frame selection based on human judgment, and detailed textual descriptions crafted by human input to ensure precision. The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human-annotated highlight frames, detailed textual descriptions and duration labeling. These descriptions encompass three critical elements: (1) Visual content; (2) Fine-grained action; and (3) Human Pose Description. Together, these elements provide the necessary precision to identify the exact highlight frames in videos. To tackle this problem, we have collected two distinct datasets: (i) ShotGPT4o Dataset, which is algorithmically generated by GPT-4o and (ii) Image-SMPLText Dataset, a dataset with large-scale and accurate per-frame pose description leveraging PoseScript and existing pose estimation datasets. Based on these datasets, we present a strong baseline model, ShotVL, fine-tuned from InternVL, specifically for BestShot. We highlight the impressive zero-shot capabilities of our model and offer comparative analyses with existing SOTA models. ShotVL demonstrates a significant 52% improvement over InternVL on the BestShot Benchmark and a notable 57% improvement on the THUMOS14 Benchmark, all while maintaining the SOTA performance in general image classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  |

The limited number of benchmarks for long video understanding often rely solely on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, because of the inherent limitation of MCQ-based evaluation and the increasing reasoning ability of MLLMs, models can give the current answer purely by combining short video understanding with elimination, without genuinely understanding the video content. To address this gap, we introduce CG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in long videos. CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues for questions, enhancing evaluation credibility. It features 1,219 manually curated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171 secondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest benchmark for long video analysis. The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in three major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination. Compensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel clue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box evaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct understanding of the video. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source MLLMs on CG-Bench. Results indicate that current models significantly underperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a significant gap exists between open-source and commercial models. We hope CG-Bench can advance the development of more trustworthy and capable MLLMs for long video understanding. All annotations and video data are released at https://cg-bench.github.io/leaderboard/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

These methods typically struggle to maintain performance over longer durations and to handle the intricate dependencies within the video content. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective large multi-modal model framework for long-term video understanding that incorporates a novel visual compressor, the In-context, Question Adaptive Visual Compressor (IQViC).

Our framework utilizes IQViC, a transformer-based visual compressor, enabling question-conditioned in-context compression, unlike existing methods that rely on full video visual features. This selectively extracts relevant information, significantly reducing memory token requirements. Through extensive experiments on a new dataset based on InfiniBench for long-term video understanding, and standard benchmarks used for existing methods' evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IQViC framework and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of video understanding accuracy and memory efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first and second authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full model can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be extended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively "easier" videos. Our resulting approach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI.

| **[Overview of TREC 2024 Medical Video Question Answering (MedVidQA) Track](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11056v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key goals of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of a multimodal system that facilitates communication with the visual world (image and video) using a natural language query. Earlier works on medical question answering primarily focused on textual and visual (image) modalities, which may be inefficient in answering questions requiring demonstration. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved due to the introduction of large-scale language-vision datasets and the development of efficient deep neural techniques that bridge the gap between language and visual understanding. Improvements have been made in numerous vision-and-language tasks, such as visual captioning visual question answering, and natural language video localization. Most of the existing work on language vision focused on creating datasets and developing solutions for open-domain applications. We believe medical videos may provide the best possible answers to many first aid, medical emergency, and medical education questions. With increasing interest in AI to support clinical decision-making and improve patient engagement, there is a need to explore such challenges and develop efficient algorithms for medical language-video understanding and generation. Toward this, we introduced new tasks to foster research toward designing systems that can understand medical videos to provide visual answers to natural language questions, and are equipped with multimodal capability to generate instruction steps from the medical video. These tasks have the potential to support the development of sophisticated downstream applications that can benefit the public and medical professionals.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, many design decisions in this domain are made without proper justification or analysis. The high computational cost of training and evaluating such models, coupled with limited open research, hinders the development of video-LMMs. To address this, we present a comprehensive study that helps uncover what effectively drives video understanding in LMMs. We begin by critically examining the primary contributors to the high computational requirements associated with video-LMM research and discover Scaling Consistency, wherein design and training decisions made on smaller models and datasets (up to a critical size) effectively transfer to larger models. Leveraging these insights, we explored many video-specific aspects of video-LMMs, including video sampling, architectures, data composition, training schedules, and more. For example, we demonstrated that fps sampling during training is vastly preferable to uniform frame sampling and which vision encoders are the best for video representation. Guided by these findings, we introduce Apollo, a state-of-the-art family of LMMs that achieve superior performance across different model sizes. Our models can perceive hour-long videos efficiently, with Apollo-3B outperforming most existing $7$B models with an impressive 55.1 on LongVideoBench. Apollo-7B is state-of-the-art compared to 7B LMMs with a 70.9 on MLVU, and 63.3 on Video-MME.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://apollo-lmms.github.io</p></details> |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhuqiangLu/B-VLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongVILA: Scaling Long-Context Visual Language Models for Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10188v6)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models, especially for long video understanding. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long context extension and long video supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 2048, achieving 99.8% accuracy in 6,000-frame (more than 1 million tokens) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-7B demonstrates strong accuracy on 9 popular video benchmarks, e.g. 65.1% VideoMME with subtitle. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring style sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with a hybrid context and tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA/tree/main/longvila</p></details> |
| **[VCA: Video Curious Agent for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10471v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding poses unique challenges due to their temporal complexity and low information density. Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PVC: Progressive Visual Token Compression for Unified Image and Video Processing in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09613v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been extended to understand both images and videos. Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the considerable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different tasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos separately with different token compression strategies, limiting the capabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image into a "static" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called Progressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are progressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information not extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed with exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static videos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple frames. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited number of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal changes can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks, including long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our unified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image benchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLAVIDAL: A Large LAnguage VIsion Model for Daily Activities of Living](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09390v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Vision Models (LLVMs) trained on web videos perform well in general video understanding but struggle with fine-grained details, complex human-object interactions (HOI), and view-invariant representation learning essential for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This limitation stems from a lack of specialized ADL video instruction-tuning datasets and insufficient modality integration to capture discriminative action representations. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for curating ADL datasets, creating ADL-X, a multiview, multimodal RGBS instruction-tuning dataset. Additionally, we introduce LLAVIDAL, an LLVM integrating videos, 3D skeletons, and HOIs to model ADL's complex spatiotemporal relationships. For training LLAVIDAL a simple joint alignment of all modalities yields suboptimal results; thus, we propose a Multimodal Progressive (MMPro) training strategy, incorporating modalities in stages following a curriculum. We also establish ADL MCQ and video description benchmarks to assess LLVM performance in ADL tasks. Trained on ADL-X, LLAVIDAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ADL benchmarks. Code and data will be made publicly available at: https://adl-x.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Espresso: High Compression For Rich Extraction From Videos for Your Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04729v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the current vision-language models (VLMs) for videos struggle to understand videos longer than a few seconds. This is primarily due to the fact that they do not scale to utilizing a large number of frames. In order to address this limitation, we propose Espresso, a novel method that extracts and compresses spatial and temporal information separately. Through extensive evaluations, we show that spatial and temporal compression in Espresso each have a positive impact on the long-form video understanding capabilities; when combined, their positive impact increases. Furthermore, we show that Espresso's performance scales well with more training data, and that Espresso is far more effective than the existing projectors for VLMs in long-form video understanding. Moreover, we devise a more difficult evaluation setting for EgoSchema called "needle-in-a-haystack" that multiplies the lengths of the input videos. Espresso achieves SOTA performance on this task, outperforming the SOTA VLMs that have been trained on much more training data.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long Video Understanding via Fine-detailed Video Story Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06182v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding has become a critical task in computer vision, driving advancements across numerous applications from surveillance to content retrieval. Existing video understanding methods suffer from two challenges when dealing with long video understanding: intricate long-context relationship modeling and interference from redundancy. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fine-Detailed Video Story generation (FDVS), which interprets long videos into detailed textual representations. Specifically, to achieve fine-grained modeling of long-temporal content, we propose a Bottom-up Video Interpretation Mechanism that progressively interprets video content from clips to video. To avoid interference from redundant information in videos, we introduce a Semantic Redundancy Reduction mechanism that removes redundancy at both the visual and textual levels. Our method transforms long videos into hierarchical textual representations that contain multi-granularity information of the video. With these representations, FDVS is applicable to various tasks without any fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed method across eight datasets spanning three tasks. The performance demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</p></details> |  |

In practice, we face the difficulty of huge requirements for GPU resource if we need to deploy MLLMs online. In this paper, we propose COEF-VQ, a novel cascaded MLLM framework for better video quality understanding on TikTok. To this end, we first propose a MLLM fusing all visual, textual and audio signals, and then develop a cascade framework with a lightweight model as pre-filtering stage and MLLM as fine-consideration stage, significantly reducing the need for GPU resource, while retaining the performance demonstrated solely by MLLM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of COEF-VQ, we deployed this new framework onto the video management platform (VMP) at TikTok, and performed a series of detailed experiments on two in-house tasks related to video quality understanding. We show that COEF-VQ leads to substantial performance gains with limit resource consumption in these two tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Video-LLMs still face challenges in effectively integrating the rich and diverse audio-visual information inherent in long videos, which is crucial for comprehensive understanding. This raises the question: how can we leverage embedded audio-visual information to enhance long video understanding? Therefore, (i) we introduce SAVEn-Vid, the first-ever long audio-visual video dataset comprising over 58k audio-visual instructions. (ii) From the model perspective, we propose a time-aware Audio-Visual Large Language Model (AV-LLM), SAVEnVideo, fine-tuned on SAVEn-Vid. (iii) Besides, we present AVBench, a benchmark containing 2,500 QAs designed to evaluate models on enhanced audio-visual comprehension tasks within long video, challenging their ability to handle intricate audio-visual interactions. Experiments on AVBench reveal the limitations of current AV-LLMs. Experiments also demonstrate that SAVEnVideo outperforms the best Video-LLM by 3.61% on the zero-shot long video task (Video-MME) and surpasses the leading audio-visual LLM by 1.29% on the zero-shot audio-visual task (Music-AVQA). Consequently, at the 7B parameter scale, SAVEnVideo can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

We propose a method to tackle this challenge from two crucial perspectives: data and modeling. Given the absence of a multi-grained video-text pretraining dataset, we introduce a Granularity EXpansion (GEX) method with Integration and Compression operations to expand the granularity of a single-grained dataset. To better model multi-grained data, we introduce an Iterative Approximation Module (IAM), which embeds multi-grained videos and texts into a unified, low-dimensional semantic space while preserving essential information for cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, GEXIA is highly scalable with no restrictions on the number of video-text granularities for alignment. We evaluate our work on three categories of video tasks across seven benchmark datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable performance. Remarkably, our model excels in tasks involving long-form video understanding, even though the pretraining dataset only contains short video clips.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-XL: Extra-Long Vision Language Model for Hour-Scale Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14485v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this alignment demands advanced music generation capabilities, sophisticated video understanding, and an efficient mechanism to learn the correspondence between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose VidMusician, a parameter-efficient video-to-music generation framework built upon text-to-music models. VidMusician leverages hierarchical visual features to ensure semantic and rhythmic alignment between video and music. Specifically, our approach utilizes global visual features as semantic conditions and local visual features as rhythmic cues. These features are integrated into the generative backbone via cross-attention and in-attention mechanisms, respectively. Through a two-stage training process, we incrementally incorporate semantic and rhythmic features, utilizing zero initialization and identity initialization to maintain the inherent music-generative capabilities of the backbone. Additionally, we construct a diverse video-music dataset, DVMSet, encompassing various scenarios, such as promo videos, commercials, and compilations. Experiments demonstrate that VidMusician outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibits robust performance on AI-generated videos.

This comparative analysis aims to advance and interpret deep neural networks and enhance our understanding of biological neural systems. However, previous works did not consider the time aspect and how the encoding of video and dynamics in deep networks relate to the biological neural systems within a large-scale comparison. Towards this end, we propose the first large-scale study focused on comparing video understanding models with respect to the visual cortex recordings using video stimuli. The study encompasses more than two million regression fits, examining image vs. video understanding, convolutional vs. transformer-based and fully vs. self-supervised models. Additionally, we propose a novel neural encoding scheme to better encode biological neural systems. We provide key insights on how video understanding models predict visual cortex responses; showing video understanding better than image understanding models, convolutional models are better in the early-mid visual cortical regions than transformer based ones except for multiscale transformers, and that two-stream models are better than single stream. Furthermore, we propose a novel neural encoding scheme that is built on top of the best performing video understanding models, while incorporating inter-intra region connectivity across the visual cortex. Our neural encoding leverages the encoded dynamics from video stimuli, through utilizing two-stream networks and multiscale transformers, while taking connectivity priors into consideration. Our results show that merging both intra and inter-region connectivity priors increases the encoding performance over each one of them standalone or no connectivity priors. It also shows the necessity for encoding dynamics to fully benefit from such connectivity priors.</p></details> | Title change |

Traditional strategies, such as aggregating region proposals, often suffer from feature variance due to the inclusion of background information. We introduce a novel instance mask-based feature aggregation approach, significantly refining this process and deepening the understanding of object dynamics across video frames. We present FAIM, a new VOD method that enhances temporal Feature Aggregation by leveraging Instance Mask features. In particular, we propose the lightweight Instance Feature Extraction Module (IFEM) to learn instance mask features and the Temporal Instance Classification Aggregation Module (TICAM) to aggregate instance mask and classification features across video frames. Using YOLOX as a base detector, FAIM achieves 87.9% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset at 33 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU, setting a new benchmark for the speed-accuracy trade-off.

However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

An effective representation for long videos must process such redundancy efficiently while preserving essential contents for downstream tasks. This paper introduces SEmantic Attention Learning (SEAL), a novel unified representation for long videos. To reduce computational complexity, long videos are decomposed into three distinct types of semantic entities: scenes, objects, and actions, allowing models to operate on a handful of entities rather than a large number of frames or pixels. To further address redundancy, we propose an attention learning module that balances token relevance with diversity formulated as a subset selection optimization problem. Our representation is versatile, enabling applications across various long video understanding tasks. Extensive experiments show that SEAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks and benchmarks including LVBench, MovieChat-1K, and Ego4D.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidHalluc: Evaluating Temporal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03735v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, excelling in content reasoning and instruction-following tasks. However, the problem of hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that the visual encoder of MLLMs often struggles to differentiate between video pairs that are visually distinct but semantically similar, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding tasks. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. VidHalluc consists of 5,002 videos, paired based on semantic similarity and visual differences, focusing on cases where hallucinations are most likely to occur. Through comprehensive testing, our experiments show that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency information from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results demonstrate that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations among all tasks.

We address this setting by proposing a novel task for multimodal video understanding-Streaming Detection of Queried Event Start (SDQES). The goal of SDQES is to identify the beginning of a complex event as described by a natural language query, with high accuracy and low latency. We introduce a new benchmark based on the Ego4D dataset, as well as new task-specific metrics to study streaming multimodal detection of diverse events in an egocentric video setting. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in NLP and for video tasks, we propose adapter-based baselines that enable image-to-video transfer learning, allowing for efficient online video modeling. We evaluate three vision-language backbones and three adapter architectures on both short-clip and untrimmed video settings.</p></details> |  |

However, while existing models can understand images and videos at a holistic level, they still struggle with instance-level understanding that requires a more nuanced comprehension and alignment. Instance-level understanding is crucial, as it focuses on the specific elements that we are most interested in. Excitingly, existing works find that the state-of-the-art LMMs exhibit strong instance understanding capabilities when provided with explicit visual cues. Motivated by this, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline assisted by GPT-4o to extract instance-level information from images and videos through explicit visual prompting for instance guidance. Building upon this pipeline, we proposed Inst-IT, a solution to enhance LMMs in Instance understanding via explicit visual prompt Instruction Tuning. Inst-IT consists of a benchmark to diagnose multimodal instance-level understanding, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a continuous instruction-tuning training paradigm to effectively enhance spatial-temporal instance understanding capabilities of existing LMMs. Experimental results show that, with the boost of Inst-IT, our models not only achieve outstanding performance on Inst-IT Bench but also demonstrate significant improvements across various generic image and video understanding benchmarks. This highlights that our dataset not only boosts instance-level understanding but also strengthens the overall capabilities of generic image and video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://inst-it.github.io</p></details> |

However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that, our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, under a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code will be available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Long-term temporal reasoning is a key desideratum for frame retrieval systems. While state-of-the-art foundation models, like VideoLLaMA and ViCLIP, are proficient in short-term semantic understanding, they surprisingly fail at long-term reasoning across frames. A key reason for this failure is that they intertwine per-frame perception and temporal reasoning into a single deep network. Hence, decoupling but co-designing semantic understanding and temporal reasoning is essential for efficient scene identification. We propose a system that leverages vision-language models for semantic understanding of individual frames but effectively reasons about the long-term evolution of events using state machines and temporal logic (TL) formulae that inherently capture memory. Our TL-based reasoning improves the F1 score of complex event identification by 9-15% compared to benchmarks that use GPT4 for reasoning on state-of-the-art self-driving datasets such as Waymo and NuScenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024</p></details> |

However, their performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that are underrepresented in training data. Traditional methods like fine-tuning on OOD datasets are impractical due to high computational costs. While In-context learning (ICL) with demonstration examples has shown promising generalization performance in language tasks and image-language tasks without fine-tuning, applying ICL to video-language tasks faces challenges due to the limited context length in Video LMMs, as videos require longer token lengths. To address these issues, we propose VideoICL, a novel video in-context learning framework for OOD tasks that introduces a similarity-based relevant example selection strategy and a confidence-based iterative inference approach. This allows to select the most relevant examples and rank them based on similarity, to be used for inference. If the generated response has low confidence, our framework selects new examples and performs inference again, iteratively refining the results until a high-confidence response is obtained. This approach improves OOD video understanding performance by extending effective context length without incurring high costs. The experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains, especially in domain-specific scenarios, laying the groundwork for broader video comprehension applications.

Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This novel task aims to generate temporally fine-grained captions that not only accurately describe each frame but also capture the subtle progression of actions throughout a video sequence. Despite the strong capabilities of existing leading vision language models, they often struggle to discern the nuances of frame-wise differences. To address this, we propose ProgressCaptioner, a captioning model designed to capture the fine-grained temporal dynamics within an action sequence. Alongside, we develop the FrameCap dataset to support training and the FrameCapEval benchmark to assess caption quality. The results demonstrate that ProgressCaptioner significantly surpasses leading captioning models, producing precise captions that accurately capture action progression and set a new standard for temporal precision in video captioning. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our approach, specifically in aiding keyframe selection and advancing video understanding, highlighting its broad utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/ProgressCaptioner/</p></details> |

Among them, gameplay videos stand out as a distinctive data source, often containing glitches that defy physics commonsense. This characteristic renders them an effective benchmark for assessing the under-explored capability of physical commonsense understanding in video LLMs. In this paper, we propose PhysGame as a pioneering benchmark to evaluate physical commonsense violations in gameplay videos. PhysGame comprises 880 videos associated with glitches spanning four fundamental domains (i.e., mechanics, kinematics, optics, and material properties) and across 12 distinct physical commonsense. Through extensively evaluating various state-ofthe-art video LLMs, our findings reveal that the performance of current open-source video LLMs significantly lags behind that of proprietary counterparts. To bridge this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset PhysInstruct with 140,057 question-answering pairs to facilitate physical commonsense learning. In addition, we also propose a preference optimization dataset PhysDPO with 34,358 training pairs, where the dis-preferred responses are generated conditioned on misleading titles (i.e., meta information hacking), fewer frames (i.e., temporal hacking) and lower spatial resolutions (i.e., spatial hacking). Based on the suite of datasets, we propose PhysVLM as a physical knowledge-enhanced video LLM. Extensive experiments on both physical-oriented benchmark PhysGame and general video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the state-ofthe-art performance of PhysVLM.</p></details> |  |

Solutions to this new task have important implications in vision-based scene understanding, automated monitoring systems, and action planning. The proposed novel framework predicts object state changes that will occur in the near future due to yet unseen human actions by integrating learned visual features that represent recent visual information with natural language (NLP) features that represent past object state changes and actions. Leveraging the extensive and challenging Ego4D dataset which provides a large-scale collection of first-person perspective videos across numerous interaction scenarios, we introduce an extension noted Ego4D-OSCA that provides new curated annotation data for the object state change anticipation task (OSCA). An extensive experimental evaluation is presented demonstrating the proposed method's efficacy in predicting object state changes in dynamic scenarios. The performance of the proposed approach also underscores the potential of integrating video and linguistic cues to enhance the predictive performance of video understanding systems and lays the groundwork for future research on the new task of object state change anticipation. The source code and the new annotation data (Ego4D-OSCA) will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on previous successful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the success to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an efficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two mainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with video data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective data augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot inference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and lack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the fine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all the video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize video-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus. Integrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which achieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video datasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking about using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.

To address this issue from a data-centric perspective, we propose VISTA, a simple yet effective Video Spatiotemporal Augmentation framework that synthesizes long-duration and high-resolution video instruction-following pairs from existing video-caption datasets. VISTA spatially and temporally combines videos to create new synthetic videos with extended durations and enhanced resolutions, and subsequently produces question-answer pairs pertaining to these newly synthesized videos. Based on this paradigm, we develop seven video augmentation methods and curate VISTA-400K, a video instruction-following dataset aimed at enhancing long-duration and high-resolution video understanding. Finetuning various video LMMs on our data resulted in an average improvement of 3.3% across four challenging benchmarks for long-video understanding. Furthermore, we introduce the first comprehensive high-resolution video understanding benchmark HRVideoBench, on which our finetuned models achieve a 6.5% performance gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VISTA/</p></details> |

Instruction tuning (i.e., fine-tuning models on datasets of instructions paired with desired outputs) has been key to improving model performance. However, creating diverse instruction-tuning datasets is challenging due to high annotation costs and the complexity of capturing temporal information in videos. Existing approaches often rely on large language models to generate instruction-output pairs, which can limit diversity and lead to responses that lack grounding in the video content. To address this, we propose VideoSAVi (Self-Aligned Video Language Model), a novel self-training pipeline that enables VLMs to generate their own training data without extensive manual annotation. The process involves three stages: (1) generating diverse video-specific questions, (2) producing multiple candidate answers, and (3) evaluating these responses for alignment with the video content. This self-generated data is then used for direct preference optimization (DPO), allowing the model to refine its own high-quality outputs and improve alignment with video content. Our experiments demonstrate that even smaller models (0.5B and 7B parameters) can effectively use this self-training approach, outperforming previous methods and achieving results comparable to those trained on proprietary preference data. VideoSAVi shows significant improvements across multiple benchmarks: up to 28% on multi-choice QA, 8% on zero-shot open-ended QA, and 12% on temporal reasoning benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-training approach in enhancing video understanding while reducing dependence on proprietary models.</p></details> |  |

However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving. Our code are available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook.</p></details> | Under review |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  |

This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIFS</p></details> |

This paper introduces MedPromptX, the first clinical decision support system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), few-shot prompting (FP) and visual grounding (VG) to combine imagery with EHR data for chest X-ray diagnosis. A pre-trained MLLM is utilized to complement the missing EHR information, providing a comprehensive understanding of patients' medical history. Additionally, FP reduces the necessity for extensive training of MLLMs while effectively tackling the issue of hallucination. Nevertheless, the process of determining the optimal number of few-shot examples and selecting high-quality candidates can be burdensome, yet it profoundly influences model performance. Hence, we propose a new technique that dynamically refines few-shot data for real-time adjustment to new patient scenarios. Moreover, VG narrows the search area in X-ray images, thereby enhancing the identification of abnormalities. We also release MedPromptX-VQA, a new in-context visual question answering dataset encompassing interleaved images and EHR data derived from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR-JPG databases. Results demonstrate the SOTA performance of MedPromptX, achieving an 11% improvement in F1-score compared to the baselines.

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal Large Language Models be Guided to Improve Industrial Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15795v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial settings, the accurate detection of anomalies is essential for maintaining product quality and ensuring operational safety. Traditional industrial anomaly detection (IAD) models often struggle with flexibility and adaptability, especially in dynamic production environments where new defect types and operational changes frequently arise. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations by combining visual and textual information processing capabilities. MLLMs excel in general visual understanding due to their training on large, diverse datasets, but they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as industry-specific defect tolerance levels, which limits their effectiveness in IAD tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Echo, a novel multi-expert framework designed to enhance MLLM performance for IAD. Echo integrates four expert modules: Reference Extractor which provides a contextual baseline by retrieving similar normal images, Knowledge Guide which supplies domain-specific insights, Reasoning Expert which enables structured, stepwise reasoning for complex queries, and Decision Maker which synthesizes information from all modules to deliver precise, context-aware responses. Evaluated on the MMAD benchmark, Echo demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability, precision, and robustness, moving closer to meeting the demands of real-world industrial anomaly detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., "alert if my toddler is getting into mischief"), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users "stress test" sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a user study, participants reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users' "blind spots" by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we discuss how unique characteristics of MLLMs--such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses--can impact the sensor-creation process. These findings contribute to the design of future intelligent sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.</p></details> | 54 pages, 27 figures |

We employ Native Resolution ViT to enable variable resolution input and utilize a substantial collection of high-quality OCR datasets to enhance the model performance. We demonstrate the superiority of Ocean-OCR through comprehensive experiments on open-source OCR benchmarks and across various OCR scenarios. These scenarios encompass document understanding, scene text recognition, and handwritten recognition, highlighting the robust OCR capabilities of Ocean-OCR.

| **[Unveiling the Potential of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15470v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems, while promising for enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), often rely on rigid, single-step retrieval methods. This limitation hinders their ability to effectively address real-world scenarios that demand adaptive information acquisition and query refinement. To overcome this, we introduce the novel task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning), focusing on optimizing MLLM performance while minimizing computational overhead. We present CogPlanner, a versatile framework inspired by human cognitive processes. CogPlanner iteratively refines queries and selects retrieval strategies, enabling both parallel and sequential modeling approaches. To rigorously evaluate MRAG Planning, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for this task. CogBench facilitates the integration of lightweight CogPlanner with resource-efficient MLLMs. Our experimental findings demonstrate that CogPlanner surpasses existing MRAG baselines, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval via Diffusion-Augmented Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15379v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval (I-TIR) has emerged as a transformative user-interactive tool for applications in domains such as e-commerce and education. Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Multimodal Large Language Models with Visual Tokens Withdrawal for Rapid Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05803v3)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demand considerable computations for inference due to the extensive parameters and the additional input tokens needed for visual information representation. Herein, we introduce Visual Tokens Withdrawal (VTW), a plug-and-play module to boost MLLMs for rapid inference. Our approach is inspired by two intriguing phenomena we have observed: (1) the attention sink phenomenon that is prevalent in LLMs also persists in MLLMs, suggesting that initial tokens and nearest tokens receive the majority of attention, while middle vision tokens garner minimal attention in deep layers; (2) the presence of information migration, which implies that visual information is transferred to subsequent text tokens within the first few layers of MLLMs. As per our findings, we conclude that vision tokens are unnecessary in the deep layers of MLLMs. Thus, we strategically withdraw them at a certain layer, enabling only text tokens to engage in subsequent layers. To pinpoint the ideal layer for VTW, we initially analyze a limited set of tiny datasets and choose the first layer that meets the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. Our VTW approach can cut computational overhead by over 40\% across diverse multimodal tasks while maintaining performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

While recent omni models can process multiple modalities, they generally lack effectiveness in human-centric scenes due to the absence of large-scale, specialized datasets and non-targeted architectures. In this work, we developed HumanOmni, the industry's first human-centric Omni-multimodal large language model. We constructed a dataset containing over 2.4 million human-centric video clips with detailed captions and more than 14 million instructions, facilitating the understanding of diverse human-centric scenes. HumanOmni includes three specialized branches for understanding different types of scenes. It adaptively fuses features from these branches based on user instructions, significantly enhancing visual understanding in scenes centered around individuals. Moreover, HumanOmni integrates audio features to ensure a comprehensive understanding of environments and individuals. Our experiments validate HumanOmni's advanced capabilities in handling human-centric scenes across a variety of tasks, including emotion recognition, facial expression description, and action understanding. Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</p></details> |  |

However, automation of this task has been largely overlooked by the research community. To this end, we introduce PatentDesc-355K, a novel large-scale dataset containing ~355K patent figures along with their brief and detailed textual descriptions extracted from more than 60K US patent documents. In addition, we propose PatentLMM - a novel multimodal large language model specifically tailored to generate high-quality descriptions of patent figures. Our proposed PatentLMM comprises two key components: (i) PatentMME, a specialized multimodal vision encoder that captures the unique structural elements of patent figures, and (ii) PatentLLaMA, a domain-adapted version of LLaMA fine-tuned on a large collection of patents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training a vision encoder specifically designed for patent figures significantly boosts the performance, generating coherent descriptions compared to fine-tuning similar-sized off-the-shelf multimodal models. PatentDesc-355K and PatentLMM pave the way for automating the understanding of patent figures, enabling efficient knowledge sharing and faster drafting of patent documents.

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |

However, the images in existing MMKBs are generally collected for entities in encyclopedia knowledge graphs. Therefore, detailed groundings of visual semantics with linguistic concepts are lacking, which are essential for the visual concept cognition ability of multimodal models. Addressing this gap, we introduce M^2ConceptBase, the first concept-centric MMKB. M^2ConceptBase models concepts as nodes with associated images and detailed textual descriptions. We propose a context-aware multimodal symbol grounding approach to align concept-image and concept-description pairs using context information from image-text datasets. Comprising 951K images and 152K concepts, M^2ConceptBase links each concept to an average of 6.27 images and a single description, ensuring comprehensive visual and textual semantics. Human studies confirm more than 95% alignment accuracy, underscoring its quality. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that M^2ConceptBase significantly enhances VQA model performance on the OK-VQA task. M^2ConceptBase also substantially improves the fine-grained concept understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models through retrieval augmentation in two concept-related tasks, highlighting its value.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM2024.

| **[Multi-aspect Knowledge Distillation with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13341v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | Preprint |

Most existing FAS methods are formulated as binary classification tasks, providing confidence scores without interpretation. They exhibit limited generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, such as new environments or unseen spoofing types. In this work, we introduce a multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework for FAS, termed Interpretable Face Anti-Spoofing (I-FAS), which transforms the FAS task into an interpretable visual question answering (VQA) paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Spoof-aware Captioning and Filtering (SCF) strategy to generate high-quality captions for FAS images, enriching the model's supervision with natural language interpretations. To mitigate the impact of noisy captions during training, we develop a Lopsided Language Model (L-LM) loss function that separates loss calculations for judgment and interpretation, prioritizing the optimization of the former. Furthermore, to enhance the model's perception of global visual features, we design a Globally Aware Connector (GAC) to align multi-level visual representations with the language model. Extensive experiments on standard and newly devised One to Eleven cross-domain benchmarks, comprising 12 public datasets, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI2025(Oral)</p></details> |

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 main conference track</p></details> |

The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.</p></details> |  |

This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand recognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information retrieval framework designed to extract the relevant top k items from offline knowledge bases, using available information from a webpage, including logos and HTML. Our empirical results, based on three real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while maintaining model efficiency.

Existing methods, such as proxy encoding and geometry encoding, incorporate additional syntax to encode spatial information, imposing extra burdens when communicating between language and vision modules. In this study, we propose ClawMachine, offering a new methodology that explicitly notates each entity using token collectives groups of visual tokens that collaboratively represent higher level semantics. A hybrid perception mechanism is also explored to perceive and understand scenes from both discrete and continuous spaces. Our method unifies the prompt and answer of visual referential tasks without using additional syntax. By leveraging a joint vision-language vocabulary, ClawMachine further integrates referring and grounding in an auto-regressive manner, demonstrating great potential with scaled-up pre-training data. Experiments show that ClawMachine achieves superior performance on scene-level and referential understanding tasks with higher efficiency.

However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReasVQA} (Reasoning-enhanced Video Question Answering), a novel approach that leverages reasoning processes generated by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the performance of VideoQA models. Our approach consists of three phases: reasoning generation, reasoning refinement, and learning from reasoning. First, we generate detailed reasoning processes using additional MLLMs, and second refine them via a filtering step to ensure data quality. Finally, we use the reasoning data, which might be in an imperfect form, to guide the VideoQA model via multi-task learning, on how to interpret and answer questions based on a given video. We evaluate ReasVQA on three popular benchmarks, and our results establish new state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements of +2.9 on NExT-QA, +7.3 on STAR, and +5.9 on IntentQA. Our findings demonstrate the supervising benefits of integrating reasoning processes into VideoQA. Further studies validate each component of our method, also with different backbones and MLLMs, and again highlight the advantages of this simple but effective method. We offer a new perspective on enhancing VideoQA performance by utilizing advanced reasoning techniques, setting a new benchmark in this research field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to main conference at NAACL 2025; 8 pages;</p></details> |

While numerous studies have explored ways to identify these deceptive patterns, many existing solutions require significant human intervention and struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of deceptive designs. To address these challenges, we expanded the deceptive pattern taxonomy from security and privacy perspectives, refining its categories and scope. We created a comprehensive dataset of deceptive patterns by integrating existing small-scale datasets with new samples, resulting in 6,725 images and 10,421 DP instances from mobile apps and websites. We then developed DPGuard, a novel automatic tool leveraging commercial multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for deceptive pattern detection. Experimental results show that DPGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation on 2,000 popular mobile apps and websites, revealing that 23.61% of mobile screenshots and 47.27% of website screenshots feature at least one deceptive pattern instance. Through four unexplored case studies that inform security implications, we highlight the critical importance of the unified taxonomy in addressing the growing challenges of Internet deception.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by The Web Conference 2025</p></details> |

Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces \textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable direct visual processing, they face limitations in handling scientific tables due to fixed input image resolutions and insufficient numerical reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive framework for multimodal scientific table understanding and reasoning with dynamic input image resolutions. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) MMSci-Pre, a domain-specific table structure learning dataset of 52K scientific table structure recognition samples, (2) MMSci-Ins, an instruction tuning dataset with 12K samples across three table-based tasks, and (3) MMSci-Eval, a benchmark with 3,114 testing samples specifically designed to evaluate numerical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our domain-specific approach with 52K scientific table images achieves superior performance compared to 150K general-domain tables, highlighting the importance of data quality over quantity. Our proposed table-based MLLMs with dynamic input resolutions show significant improvements in both general table understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities, with strong generalisation to held-out datasets.

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

VARGPT employs a next-token prediction paradigm for visual understanding and a next-scale prediction paradigm for visual autoregressive generation. VARGPT innovatively extends the LLaVA architecture, achieving efficient scale-wise autoregressive visual generation within MLLMs while seamlessly accommodating mixed-modal input and output within a single model framework. Our VARGPT undergoes a three-stage unified training process on specially curated datasets, comprising a pre-training phase and two mixed visual instruction-tuning phases. The unified training strategy are designed to achieve alignment between visual and textual features, enhance instruction following for both understanding and generation, and improve visual generation quality, respectively. Despite its LLAVA-based architecture for multimodel understanding, VARGPT significantly outperforms LLaVA-1.5 across various vision-centric benchmarks, such as visual question-answering and reasoning tasks. Notably, VARGPT naturally supports capabilities in autoregressive visual generation and instruction-to-image synthesis, showcasing its versatility in both visual understanding and generation tasks.

However, their potential in multimodal representation, particularly for item-to-item (I2I) recommendations, remains underexplored. While leveraging existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for such tasks is promising, challenges arise due to their delayed release compared to corresponding LLMs and the inefficiency in representation tasks. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end fine-tuning method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders for efficient multimodal representation. Preliminary experiments revealed that fine-tuned LLMs often neglect image content. To counteract this, we propose NoteLLM-2, a novel framework that enhances visual information. Specifically, we propose two approaches: first, a prompt-based method that segregates visual and textual content, employing a multimodal In-Context Learning strategy to balance focus across modalities; second, a late fusion technique that directly integrates visual information into the final representations. Extensive experiments, both online and offline, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/VITA (2K+ Stars by now)</p></details> |

Powerful commercial models like ChatGPT-4V and Gemini, as well as open-source ones such as LLaVA, are essentially general-purpose models and are applied to solve a wide variety of tasks, including those in computer vision. These neural networks possess such strong general knowledge and reasoning abilities that they have proven capable of working even on tasks for which they were not specifically trained. We compared the capabilities of the most powerful MLLMs to date: ShareGPT4V, ChatGPT, LLaVA-Next in a specialized task of age and gender estimation with our state-of-the-art specialized model, MiVOLO. We also updated MiVOLO and provide details and new metrics in this article. This comparison has yielded some interesting results and insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the participating models. Furthermore, we attempted various ways to fine-tune the ShareGPT4V model for this specific task, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results in this particular challenge. Although such a model would not be practical in production, as it is incredibly expensive compared to a specialized model like MiVOLO, it could be very useful in some tasks, like data annotation.</p></details> |  |

However, these challenges can be more naturally tackled by humans through visual representations that harness our innate ability for spatial reasoning. In this study, we propose transforming graphs into images to preserve their higher-order structural features accurately, revolutionizing the representation used in solving graph-structured combinatorial tasks. This approach allows machines to emulate human-like processing in addressing complex combinatorial challenges. By combining the innovative paradigm powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simple search techniques, we aim to develop a novel and effective framework for tackling such problems. Our investigation into MLLMs spanned a variety of graph-based tasks, from combinatorial problems like influence maximization to sequential decision-making in network dismantling, as well as addressing six fundamental graph-related issues. Our findings demonstrate that MLLMs exhibit exceptional spatial intelligence and a distinctive capability for handling these problems, significantly advancing the potential for machines to comprehend and analyze graph-structured data with a depth and intuition akin to human cognition. These results also imply that integrating MLLMs with simple optimization strategies could form a novel and efficient approach for navigating graph-structured combinatorial challenges without complex derivations, computationally demanding training and fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of this task. However, existing methods typically focus on either plain text or a limited number of document images, struggling to handle long PDF documents with interleaved text and images, especially for academic papers. In this paper, we introduce PDF-WuKong, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) which is designed to enhance multimodal question-answering (QA) for long PDF documents. PDF-WuKong incorporates a sparse sampler that operates on both text and image representations, significantly improving the efficiency and capability of the MLLM. The sparse sampler is integrated with the MLLM's image encoder and selects the paragraphs or diagrams most pertinent to user queries for processing by the language model. To effectively train and evaluate our model, we construct PaperPDF, a dataset consisting of a broad collection of English and Chinese academic papers. Multiple strategies are proposed to automatically generate 1.1 million QA pairs along with their corresponding evidence sources. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of our approach over other models on the task of long multimodal document understanding, surpassing proprietary products by an average of 8.6% on F1.

In the context of robotic-assisted surgery, MLLMs can serve as effective tools for surgical training and guidance. However, there is still a lack of MLLMs specialized for surgical scene understanding in clinical applications. In this work, we introduce EndoChat to address various dialogue paradigms and subtasks in surgical scene understanding that surgeons encounter. To train our EndoChat, we construct the Surg-396K dataset through a novel pipeline that systematically extracts surgical information and generates structured annotations based on collected large-scale endoscopic surgery datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-scale visual token interaction mechanism and a visual contrast-based reasoning mechanism to enhance the model's representation learning and reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across five dialogue paradigms and eight surgical scene understanding tasks. Additionally, we conduct evaluations with professional surgeons, most of whom provide positive feedback on collaborating with EndoChat. Overall, these results demonstrate that our EndoChat has great potential to significantly advance training and automation in robotic-assisted surgery.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Image Content Moderation (ICM) models fall short in producing precise moderation decisions for diverse standards, while recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), when adopted to general rule-based ICM, often produce classification and explanation results that are inconsistent with human moderators. Aiming at flexible, explainable, and accurate ICM, we design a novel rule-based dataset generation pipeline, decomposing concise human-defined rules and leveraging well-designed multi-stage prompts to enrich short explicit image annotations. Our ICM-Instruct dataset includes detailed moderation explanation and moderation Q-A pairs. Built upon it, we create our ICM-Assistant model in the framework of rule-based ICM, making it readily applicable in real practice. Our ICM-Assistant model demonstrates exceptional performance and flexibility. Specifically, it significantly outperforms existing approaches on various sources, improving both the moderation classification (36.8% on average) and moderation explanation quality (26.6% on average) consistently over existing MLLMs. Code/Data is available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/ICM-Assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI 2025</p></details> |

These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: "list items one by one," which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of "list items one by one" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM.

Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  |

The answer is No!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10674v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) by leveraging foundational Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their abilities in specific areas such as temporal understanding, which is crucial for comprehending real-world dynamics, remain underexplored. To address this, we propose a challenging evaluation benchmark named TemporalVQA, consisting of two parts: (1) Temporal Order Understanding and (2) Time-lapse Estimation. The first part requires MLLMs to determine the sequence of events by analyzing temporally consecutive video frames. The second part presents image pairs with varying time differences, framed as multiple-choice questions, asking MLLMs to estimate the time-lapse between images with options ranging from seconds to years. Our evaluations of advanced MLLMs, including models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, reveal significant challenges: GPT-4o achieved only 43.8% average consistent accuracy in temporal order tasks and 70% in time-lapse estimation, with open-source models performing even less effectively. These findings underscore the limitations of current MLLMs in visual temporal understanding and reasoning, highlighting the need for further improvements in their temporal capabilities.

However, analyzing footage from hundreds, if not thousands, of traffic cameras in a 24/7/365 working protocol remains an extremely challenging task, as current vision-based approaches primarily focus on extracting raw information, such as vehicle trajectories or individual object detection, but require laborious post-processing to derive actionable insights. We propose SeeUnsafe, a new framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents to transform video-based traffic accident analysis from a traditional extraction-then-explanation workflow to a more interactive, conversational approach. This shift significantly enhances processing throughput by automating complex tasks like video classification and visual grounding, while improving adaptability by enabling seamless adjustments to diverse traffic scenarios and user-defined queries. Our framework employs a severity-based aggregation strategy to handle videos of various lengths and a novel multimodal prompt to generate structured responses for review and evaluation and enable fine-grained visual grounding. We introduce IMS (Information Matching Score), a new MLLM-based metric for aligning structured responses with ground truth. We conduct extensive experiments on the Toyota Woven Traffic Safety dataset, demonstrating that SeeUnsafe effectively performs accident-aware video classification and visual grounding by leveraging off-the-shelf MLLMs. Source code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe}.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement.

To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping. Built from 3.4K original videos-expanded to over 17K tampered clips spanning 19 video tasks. MVTamperBench challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families, revealing substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and showing that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms.

Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with image-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a visual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text pairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by existing multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal visual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage from image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, including LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Llama3.2-Vision, and GPT-4o. This study demonstrates that textual alignment is enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is a more promising solution for multimodal safety scenarios without VSIL.

It leverages the knowledge previously encoded within these language models, thereby enhancing their applicability and functionality in the reign of multimodal contexts. Recent works investigate the adaptation of MLLMs as a universal solution to address medical multi-modal problems as a generative task. In this paper, we propose a parameter efficient framework for fine-tuning MLLMs, specifically validated on medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) and medical report generation (MRG) tasks, using public benchmark datasets. We also introduce an evaluation metric using the 5-point Likert scale and its weighted average value to measure the quality of the generated reports for MRG tasks, where the scale ratings are labelled by both humans manually and the GPT-4 model. We further assess the consistency of performance metrics across traditional measures, GPT-4, and human ratings for both VQA and MRG tasks. The results indicate that semantic similarity assessments using GPT-4 align closely with human annotators and provide greater stability, yet they reveal a discrepancy when compared to conventional lexical similarity measurements. This questions the reliability of lexical similarity metrics for evaluating the performance of generative models in Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Besides, our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms GPT-4v. This indicates that without additional fine-tuning, multi-modal models like GPT-4v do not perform effectively on medical imaging tasks.

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a gold standard for achieving absolute quantification. While computational ddPCR technologies have advanced significantly, achieving automatic interpretation and consistent adaptability across diverse operational environments remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce the intelligent interpretable droplet digital PCR (I2ddPCR) assay, a comprehensive framework integrating front-end predictive models (for droplet segmentation and classification) with GPT-4o multimodal large language model (MLLM, for context-aware explanations and recommendations) to automate and enhance ddPCR image analysis. This approach surpasses the state-of-the-art models, affording 99.05% accuracy in processing complex ddPCR images containing over 300 droplets per image with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining specialized neural networks and large language models, the I2ddPCR assay offers a robust and adaptable solution for absolute molecular quantification, achieving a sensitivity capable of detecting low-abundance targets as low as 90.32 copies/{\mu}L. Furthermore, it improves model's transparency through detailed explanation and troubleshooting guidance, empowering users to make informed decisions. This innovative framework has the potential to benefit molecular diagnostics, disease research, and clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, including consistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships, motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy. We further carefully design evaluation metrics of multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based, detection-based, and tracking-based metrics, which can better reflect the compositional text-to-video generation quality of seven proposed categories with 1400 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models and various compositional categories.

However, their inference efficiency has been a notable concern, as the increasing length of multimodal contexts leads to quadratic complexity. Token compression techniques, which reduce the number of visual tokens, have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing computational costs. Yet, these approaches have struggled to keep pace with the rapid advancements in MLLMs, especially the AnyRes strategy in the context of high-resolution image understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel token compression method, GlobalCom$^2$, tailored for high-resolution MLLMs that receive both the thumbnail and multiple crops. GlobalCom$^2$ treats the tokens derived from the thumbnail as the "commander" of the entire token compression process, directing the allocation of retention ratios and the specific compression for each crop. In this way, redundant tokens are eliminated while important local details are adaptively preserved to the highest extent feasible.

To overcome these challenges, we propose VRS-HQ, an end-to-end video reasoning segmentation approach that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to inject rich spatiotemporal features into hierarchical tokens.Our key innovations include a Temporal Dynamic Aggregation (TDA) and a Token-driven Keyframe Selection (TKS). Specifically, we design frame-level <SEG> and temporal-level <TAK> tokens that utilize MLLM's autoregressive learning to effectively capture both local and global information. Subsequently, we apply a similarity-based weighted fusion and frame selection strategy, then utilize SAM2 to perform keyframe segmentation and propagation. To enhance keyframe localization accuracy, the TKS filters keyframes based on SAM2's occlusion scores during inference. VRS-HQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReVOS, surpassing VISA by 5.9%/12.5%/9.1% in J&F scores across the three subsets. These results highlight the strong temporal reasoning and segmentation capabilities of our method. Code and model weights will be released at VRS-HQ.</p></details> |  |

To achieve consistent region representation across spatio-temporal dimensions, we introduce Token Mark, a set of tokens highlighting the target regions within the visual feature space. These tokens are directly embedded into spatial regions using region prompts (e.g., boxes or masks) and simultaneously incorporated into the text prompt to specify the target, establishing a direct connection between visual and text tokens. To further support robust video understanding without requiring tracklets, we introduce an auxiliary task that guides Token Mark by leveraging the consistency of the tokens, enabling stable region interpretation across the video. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale region-level video instruction dataset (RegVID-300k). Omni-RGPT achieves state-of-the-art results on image and video-based commonsense reasoning benchmarks while showing strong performance in captioning and referring expression comprehension tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://miranheo.github.io/omni-rgpt/</p></details> |

This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding. Our code, data and benchmark will be released at Our code, data and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/appletea233/LLaVA-ST .</p></details> |  |
| **[EventHallusion: Diagnosing Event Hallucinations in Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16597v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in the video comprehension field. Despite remarkable content reasoning and instruction following capabilities they demonstrated, the hallucination problem of these VideoLLMs is less explored compared with its counterpart in the image domain. To mitigate this gap, we propose EventHallusion, a novel benchmark that focuses on assessing the VideoLLMs' hallucination toward event, the crux of video analysis. From a hallucination attribution perspective, our EventHallusion benchmark is curated to assess a VideoLLM's susceptibility toward language priors and vision-language biases. On the other hand, we also propose a simple yet effective method, called Temporal Contrastive Decoding (TCD), to tackle the hallucination problems of VideoLLMs. The proposed TCD method rectifies the model's bias toward its priors during the decoding stage by comparing the original video with a modified version, in which temporal cues are disrupted. Through comprehensive evaluation of eight open-source and two closed-source VideoLLMs on the proposed EventHallusion benchmark, we observe that the open-source models suffer significantly from hallucination problems, whereas the closed-source ones perform markedly better. By further equipping open-source VideoLLMs with the proposed TCD approach, evident performance improvements are achieved across most metrics in the EventHallusion benchmark. Our codes and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/Stevetich/EventHallusion.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown promise in general video understanding tasks. However, describing facial expressions within videos poses two major challenges for these models: (1) the lack of adequate datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the limited visual token capacity of video MLLMs. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new instruction-following dataset tailored for dynamic facial expression caption. The dataset comprises 5,033 high-quality video clips annotated manually, containing over 700,000 tokens. Its purpose is to improve the capability of video MLLMs to discern subtle facial nuances. Furthermore, we propose FaceTrack-MM, which leverages a limited number of tokens to encode the main character's face. This model demonstrates superior performance in tracking faces and focusing on the facial expressions of the main characters, even in intricate multi-person scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric combining event extraction, relation classification, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to assess the content consistency and temporal sequence consistency of generated text. Moreover, we present FEC-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of existing video MLLMs in this specific task. All data and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Existing VMR methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. Although some recent studies introduce a zero-shot setting to avoid fine-tuning, they overlook inherent language bias in the query, leading to erroneous localization. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes Moment-GPT, a tuning-free pipeline for zero-shot VMR utilizing frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we first employ LLaMA-3 to correct and rephrase the query to mitigate language bias. Subsequently, we design a span generator combined with MiniGPT-v2 to produce candidate spans adaptively. Finally, to leverage the video comprehension capabilities of MLLMs, we apply VideoChatGPT and span scorer to select the most appropriate spans. Our proposed method substantially outperforms the state-ofthe-art MLLM-based and zero-shot models on several public datasets, including QVHighlights, ActivityNet-Captions, and Charades-STA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We find that the limitations mainly lie in: i) the high annotation cost restricting the scale-up of volumes of 3D scene data, and ii) the lack of a straightforward and effective way to perceive 3D information which results in prolonged training durations and complicates the streamlined framework. To this end, we develop pipeline based on open-source 2D MLLMs and LLMs to generate high-quality 3D-text pairs and construct 3DS-160K , to enhance the pre-training process. Leveraging this high-quality pre-training data, we introduce the 3UR-LLM model, an end-to-end 3D MLLM designed for precise interpretation of 3D scenes, showcasing exceptional capability in navigating the complexities of the physical world. 3UR-LLM directly receives 3D point cloud as input and project 3D features fused with text instructions into a manageable set of tokens. Considering the computation burden derived from these hybrid tokens, we design a 3D compressor module to cohesively compress the 3D spatial cues and textual narrative. 3UR-LLM achieves promising performance with respect to the previous SOTAs, for instance, 3UR-LLM exceeds its counterparts by 7.1\% CIDEr on ScanQA, while utilizing fewer training resources. The code and model weights for 3UR-LLM and the 3DS-160K benchmark are available at 3UR-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks for Visual Perception and Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07783v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image pyramids are widely adopted in top-performing methods to obtain multi-scale features for precise visual perception and understanding. However, current image pyramids use the same large-scale model to process multiple resolutions of images, leading to significant computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture, called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Specifically, PIIP uses pretrained models (ViTs or CNNs) as branches to process multi-scale images, where images of higher resolutions are processed by smaller network branches to balance computational cost and performance. To integrate information from different spatial scales, we further propose a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism. To validate PIIP, we apply it to various perception models and a representative multimodal large language model called LLaVA, and conduct extensive experiments on various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image classification and multimodal understanding. PIIP achieves superior performance compared to single-branch and existing multi-resolution approaches with lower computational cost. When applied to InternViT-6B, a large-scale vision foundation model, PIIP can improve its performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original computation, finally achieving 60.0 box AP on MS COCO and 59.7 mIoU on ADE20K. For multimodal understanding, our PIIP-LLaVA achieves 73.0% accuracy on TextVQA and 74.5% on MMBench with only 2.8M training data. Our code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PIIP.</p></details> |  |

Yet, it struggles in complex spatial reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, human cognition extends beyond language alone, enabling the remarkable capability to think in both words and images. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose a new reasoning paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT). It enables visual thinking in MLLMs by generating image visualizations of their reasoning traces. To ensure high-quality visualization, we introduce token discrepancy loss into autoregressive MLLMs. This innovation significantly improves both visual coherence and fidelity. We validate this approach through several dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. Experimental results reveal that MVoT demonstrates competitive performance across tasks. Moreover, it exhibits robust and reliable improvements in the most challenging scenarios where CoT fails. Ultimately, MVoT establishes new possibilities for complex reasoning tasks where visual thinking can effectively complement verbal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables (27 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09698v5)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 21.61% and even surpassing much larger 70B models.

In response, numerous challenging and comprehensive benchmarks have been proposed to more accurately assess the capabilities of MLLMs. However, there is a dearth of exploration of the higher-order perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To fill this gap, we propose the Image Implication understanding Benchmark, II-Bench, which aims to evaluate the model's higher-order perception of images. Through extensive experiments on II-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs attains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive 98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines.

For instance, comparing the freshness of apples enables better choices during grocery shopping while comparing sofa designs helps optimize the aesthetics of our living space. Despite its significance, the comparative capability is largely unexplored in artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CompBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the comparative reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLM-CompBench mines and pairs images through visually oriented questions covering eight dimensions of relative comparison: visual attribute, existence, state, emotion, temporality, spatiality, quantity, and quality. We curate a collection of around 40K image pairs using metadata from diverse vision datasets and CLIP similarity scores. These image pairs span a broad array of visual domains, including animals, fashion, sports, and both outdoor and indoor scenes. The questions are carefully crafted to discern relative characteristics between two images and are labeled by human annotators for accuracy and relevance. We use MLLM-CompBench to evaluate recent MLLMs, including GPT-4V(ision), Gemini-Pro, and LLaVA-1.6. Our results reveal notable shortcomings in their comparative abilities.

Recent hybrid MLLMs incorporate a mixture of vision experts to address the limitations of using a single vision encoder and excessively long visual tokens. Despite the progress of these MLLMs, a research gap remains in effectively integrating diverse vision encoders. This work explores fusion strategies of visual tokens for hybrid MLLMs, leading to the design of LEO, a novel MLLM with a dual-branch vision encoder framework that incorporates a post-adaptation fusion strategy and adaptive tiling: for each segmented tile of the input images, LEO sequentially interleaves the visual tokens from its two vision encoders. Extensive evaluation across 13 vision-language benchmarks reveals that LEO outperforms state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs and hybrid MLLMs on the majority of tasks. Furthermore, we show that LEO can be adapted to the specialized domain of autonomous driving without altering the model architecture or training recipe, achieving competitive performance compared to existing baselines.

However, existing benchmark datasets primarily focus on single, short-duration videos or moderately long videos up to dozens of minutes, leaving a substantial gap in evaluating extensive, ultra-long egocentric video recordings. To address this, we introduce X-LeBench, a novel benchmark dataset specifically crafted for evaluating tasks on extremely long egocentric video recordings.

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks.: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation.

The limitation is largely attributable to inadequate perception of geometric primitives during image-level contrastive pre-training (e.g., CLIP). While recent efforts to improve math MLLMs have focused on scaling up mathematical visual instruction datasets and employing stronger LLM backbones, they often overlook persistent errors in visual recognition. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the visual grounding capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a significant negative correlation between visual grounding accuracy and problem-solving performance, underscoring the critical role of fine-grained visual understanding. Notably, advanced models like GPT-4o exhibit a 70% error rate when identifying geometric entities, highlighting that this remains a key bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel approach, SVE-Math (Selective Vision-Enhanced Mathematical MLLM), featuring a geometric-grounded vision encoder and a feature router that dynamically adjusts the contribution of hierarchical visual feature maps. Our model recognizes accurate visual primitives and generates precise visual prompts tailored to the language model's reasoning needs. In experiments, SVE-Math-Qwen2.5-7B outperforms other 7B models by 15% on MathVerse and is compatible with GPT-4V on MathVista. Despite being trained on smaller datasets, SVE-Math-7B achieves competitive performance on GeoQA, rivaling models trained on significantly larger datasets.

To address this gap, we standardize and annotate the largest spoken Singlish corpus, introducing the Multitask National Speech Corpus (MNSC). These datasets support diverse tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Spoken Dialogue Summarization (SDS), and Paralinguistic Question Answering (PQA). We release standardized splits and a human-verified test set to facilitate further research. Additionally, we propose SingAudioLLM, a multi-task multimodal model leveraging multimodal large language models to handle these tasks concurrently.

However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. We introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task on interleaved images and text that involves multiple images covering plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, Datasets & Benchmarks track</p></details> |

These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map, managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules: Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI), and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o. Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs, paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MinMo: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Seamless Voice Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06282v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal speech-text models have laid the groundwork for seamless voice interactions, enabling real-time, natural, and human-like conversations. Previous models for voice interactions are categorized as native and aligned. Native models integrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues like differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training. Aligned models maintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a narrow focus on speech tasks. In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal Large Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice interaction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal models. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment, text-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction alignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of speech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation while maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates full-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between the user and the system. Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder that outperforms prior models in voice generation. The enhanced instruction-following capabilities of MinMo supports controlling speech generation based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions, dialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices. For MinMo, the speech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is approximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice. The MinMo project web page is https://funaudiollm.github.io/minmo, and the code and models will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

Despite its advances, handling extremely long videos remains challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining crucial features over extended sequences. This paper introduces a Hierarchical visual token Compression (HiCo) method designed for high-fidelity representation and a practical context modeling system VideoChat-Flash tailored for multimodal long-sequence processing. HiCo capitalizes on the redundancy of visual information in long videos to compress long video context from the clip-level to the video-level, reducing the compute significantly while preserving essential details. VideoChat-Flash features a multi-stage short-to-long learning scheme, a rich dataset of real-world long videos named LongVid, and an upgraded "Needle-In-A-video-Haystack" (NIAH) for evaluating context capacities. In extensive experiments, VideoChat-Flash shows the leading performance on both mainstream long and short video benchmarks at the 2B and 7B model scale. It firstly gets 99.1% accuracy over 10,000 frames in NIAH among open-source models.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this need, we propose an innovative end-to-end foundational framework, ultimately actualizing precise control over the final video content editing. Leveraging the flexibility and generalizability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we defined clear input-output mappings for efficient video creation. To bolster the model's capability in processing and comprehending video content, we introduce a strategic combination of a denser frame rate and a slow-fast processing technique, significantly enhancing the extraction and understanding of both temporal and spatial video information. Furthermore, we introduce a text-to-edit mechanism that allows users to achieve desired video outcomes through textual input, thereby enhancing the quality and controllability of the edited videos. Through comprehensive experimentation, our method has not only showcased significant effectiveness within advertising datasets, but also yields universally applicable conclusions on public datasets.</p></details> | 16pages conference |
| **[Towards a Multimodal Large Language Model with Pixel-Level Insight for Biomedicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09278v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Image-based Multimodal Models as Intruders: Transferable Multimodal Attacks on Video-based MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01042v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaThe: Defense against the Jailbreak Attack in Multimodal Large Language Models by Treating Harmful Instruction as Backdoor Trigger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09093v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased impressive performance in a variety of multimodal tasks. On the other hand, the integration of additional image modality may allow the malicious users to inject harmful content inside the images for jailbreaking. Unlike text-based LLMs, where adversaries need to select discrete tokens to conceal their malicious intent using specific algorithms, the continuous nature of image signals provides a direct opportunity for adversaries to inject harmful intentions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{BaThe}$ ($\textbf{Ba}$ckdoor $\textbf{T}$rigger S$\textbf{h}$i$\textbf{e}$ld), a simple yet effective jailbreak defense mechanism. Our work is motivated by recent research on jailbreak backdoor attack and virtual prompt backdoor attack in generative language models. Jailbreak backdoor attack uses harmful instructions combined with manually crafted strings as triggers to make the backdoored model generate prohibited responses. We assume that harmful instructions can function as triggers, and if we alternatively set rejection responses as the triggered response, the backdoored model then can defend against jailbreak attacks. We achieve this by utilizing virtual rejection prompt, similar to the virtual prompt backdoor attack. We embed the virtual rejection prompt into the soft text embeddings, which we call ``wedge''. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BaThe effectively mitigates various types of jailbreak attacks and is adaptable to defend against unseen attacks, with minimal impact on MLLMs' performance.</p></details> |  |

As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05662v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (EMLLMs) have rapidly advanced recently. Incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and step-by-step self-evaluation has improved their performance. However, limited parameters often hinder EMLLMs from effectively using self-evaluation during inference. Key challenges include synthesizing evaluation data, determining its quantity, optimizing training and inference strategies, and selecting appropriate prompts. To address these issues, we introduce Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (SEAT). SEAT uses more powerful EMLLMs for CoT reasoning, data selection, and evaluation generation, then trains EMLLMs with the synthesized data. However, handling long prompts and maintaining CoT reasoning quality are problematic. Therefore, we propose Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (Cas-SEAT), which breaks down lengthy prompts into shorter, task-specific cascaded prompts and reduces costs for resource-limited settings. During data synthesis, we employ open-source 7B-parameter EMLLMs and annotate a small dataset with short prompts. Experiments demonstrate that Cas-SEAT significantly boosts EMLLMs' self-evaluation abilities, improving performance by 19.68%, 55.57%, and 46.79% on the MathVista, Math-V, and We-Math datasets, respectively. Additionally, our Cas-SEAT Dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research in enhancing EMLLM self-evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://zeyofu.github.io/ReFocus/</p></details> |

EMMA: An Enhanced MultiModal ReAsoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05444v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works rely heavily on modality-specific encoders, which usually differ in architecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper, we present OneLLM, an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail, we first train an image projection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then, we build a universal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules and dynamic routing. Finally, we progressively align more modalities to LLM with the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following instructions, we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset, including 2M items from image, audio, video, point cloud, depth/normal map, IMU and fMRI brain activity.

However, most MLLMs require very high computational resources, which is a major challenge for most researchers and developers.

LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as multimodal understanding, visual question answering, and video understanding, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> |  |

To collect tactile data with minimal cost as possible, a series of studies have attempted to generate tactile images by vision-to-touch image translation. However, compared to text modality, visual modality-driven tactile generation cannot accurately depict human tactile sensation. In this work, we analyze the characteristics of tactile images in detail from two granularities: object-level (tactile texture, tactile shape), and sensor-level (gel status). We model these granularities of information through text descriptions and propose a fine-grained Text-to-Touch generation method (TextToucher) to generate high-quality tactile samples. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal large language model to build the text sentences about object-level tactile information and employ a set of learnable text prompts to represent the sensor-level tactile information. To better guide the tactile generation process with the built text information, we fuse the dual grains of text information and explore various dual-grain text conditioning methods within the diffusion transformer architecture. Furthermore, we propose a Contrastive Text-Touch Pre-training (CTTP) metric to precisely evaluate the quality of text-driven generated tactile data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our TextToucher method.

Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p></details> |  |

However, as the foundation model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art methods, e.g., LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster speed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results of closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well in overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably, Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the number of parameters.

In this chapter, we have developed a joint multimodal scene graph for charts, explicitly representing the relationships between chart elements and their associated patterns. Our proposed multimodal scene graph consists of two components: a visual graph and a textual graph, each designed to capture the structural and semantic information within the chart. To unify representations across these different modalities, we introduce a multimodal graph contrastive learning approach that learns unified representations by maximizing similarity between nodes representing the same object across multimodal graphs. The learned graph representations can be seamlessly incorporated into a transformer decoder as a soft prompt. Additionally, given the growing need for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in zero-shot scenarios, we have designed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts for MLLMs to reduce hallucinations. We tested both methods on public benchmarks such as ChartQA, OpenCQA, and ChartX, demonstrating improved performance and validating the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

In particular, multi-modal video understanding is critical to interactively analyze what will happen in the procedure of autonomous driving. However, videos in such a dynamical scene that often contains complex spatial-temporal movements, which restricts the generalization capacity of the existing MLLMs in this field. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel Hierarchical Mamba Adaptation (H-MBA) framework to fit the complicated motion changes in autonomous driving videos. Specifically, our H-MBA consists of two distinct modules, including Context Mamba (C-Mamba) and Query Mamba (Q-Mamba). First, C-Mamba contains various types of structure state space models, which can effectively capture multi-granularity video context for different temporal resolutions. Second, Q-Mamba flexibly transforms the current frame as the learnable query, and attentively selects multi-granularity video context into query. Consequently, it can adaptively integrate all the video contexts of multi-scale temporal resolutions to enhance video understanding. Via a plug-and-play paradigm in MLLMs, our H-MBA shows the remarkable performance on multi-modal video tasks in autonomous driving, e.g., for risk object detection, it outperforms the previous SOTA method with 5.5% mIoU improvement.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Recent multimodal large language models(MLLMs) exhibit powerful perceptual abilities and demonstrate impressive potential for generating object-centric descriptions. However, the descriptions generated by such models may still usually contain a lot of content that is not relevant to the user intent or miss some important object dimension details. Under special scenarios, users may only need the details of certain dimensions of an object. In this paper, we propose a training-free object description refinement pipeline, Dimension Tailor, designed to enhance user-specified details in object descriptions. This pipeline includes three steps: dimension extracting, erasing, and supplementing, which decompose the description into user-specified dimensions. Dimension Tailor can not only improve the quality of object details but also offer flexibility in including or excluding specific dimensions based on user preferences. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Dimension Tailor on controllable object descriptions. Notably, the proposed pipeline can consistently improve the performance of the recent MLLMs. The code is currently accessible at https://github.com/xin-ran-w/ControllableObjectDescription.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

MLLMs demonstrate capabilities such as generating image captions and answering image-based questions, bridging the gap towards real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in addressing the semantic gap in multimodal data, which may lead to erroneous outputs, posing potential risks to society. Selecting the appropriate modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more parameters without significant performance improvements. This paper aims to explore modality alignment methods for LLMs and their current capabilities. Implementing effective modality alignment can help LLMs address environmental issues and enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modality alignment methods for MLLMs, categorizing them into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converter, which transforms data into a format that LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceiver, which improves how LLMs percieve different types of data; (3) Tool Learning, which leverages external tools to convert data into a common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven Method, which teaches LLMs to understand specific data types within datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE |
| **[LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters through Modality Linear Representation-Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12359v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data are available at https://github.com/jam-cc/MMAD</p></details> |

Unlike previous works that rely on global attention-based projectors, our ParGo bridges the representation gap between the separately pre-trained vision encoders and the LLMs by integrating global and partial views, which alleviates the overemphasis on prominent regions. To facilitate the effective training of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset named ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality captions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and language modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo achieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ParGo significantly outperforms other projectors, particularly in tasks that emphasize detail perception ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[MULTI: Multimodal Understanding Leaderboard with Text and Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03173v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%. MULTI serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 19 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Socratic Questioning: Learn to Self-guide Multimodal Reasoning in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02964v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex visual reasoning remains a key challenge today. Typically, the challenge is tackled using methodologies such as Chain of Thought (COT) and visual instruction tuning. However, how to organically combine these two methodologies for greater success remains unexplored. Also, issues like hallucinations and high training cost still need to be addressed. In this work, we devise an innovative multi-round training and reasoning framework suitable for lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our self-questioning approach heuristically guides MLLMs to focus on visual clues relevant to the target problem, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the model's ability to describe fine-grained image details. This ultimately enables the model to perform well in complex visual reasoning and question-answering tasks. We have named this framework Socratic Questioning(SQ). To facilitate future research, we create a multimodal mini-dataset named CapQA, which includes 1k images of fine-grained activities, for visual instruction tuning and evaluation, our proposed SQ method leads to a 31.2% improvement in the hallucination score. Our extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate SQ's remarkable capabilities in heuristic self-questioning, zero-shot visual reasoning and hallucination mitigation. Our model and code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We observe that attention, as the core module of MLLMs, connects text prompt tokens and visual tokens, ultimately determining the final results. Our approach involves adjusting visual tokens from the MLP output at test time, controlling the attention response to ensure text prompt tokens attend to visual tokens in referring regions. We optimize a learnable latent variable based on an energy function, enhancing the strength of referring regions in the attention map. This enables detailed region description and reasoning without the need for substantial training costs or model retraining. Our method offers a promising direction for integrating referring abilities into MLLMs, and supports referring with box, mask, scribble and point. The results demonstrate that our method exhibits out-of-domain generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024; Code:https://github.com/mrwu-mac/ControlMLLM</p></details> |
