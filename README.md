| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 |
| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version has been removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generalist Forecasting with Frozen Video Models via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13942v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13609v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding. Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR) into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking, spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance: LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal (+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for improving compositional video reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoITG: Multimodal Video Understanding with Instructed Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13353v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on LongVideoBench.

While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Vidi: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15681v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calisthenics Skills Temporal Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12245v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics. To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, In Proceedings of the 19th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 2</p></details> |
| **[Vamba: Understanding Hour-Long Videos with Hybrid Mamba-Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11579v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Camera Ready Version.

However, existing video captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric, overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight, capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets, UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities, featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in unconstrained real-world UGC settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbRACE-3K: Embodied Reasoning and Action in Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10548v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework. The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation, object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below 20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mxllc.github.io/EmbRACE-3K/</p></details> |
| **[Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisCo: Towards Distinct and Coherent Visual Encapsulation in Video MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10302v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

To overcome these limitations, this work introduces geometric awareness to enhance VIS robustness by strategically leveraging monocular depth estimation. We systematically investigate three distinct integration paradigms. Expanding Depth Channel (EDC) method concatenates the depth map as input channel to segmentation networks; Sharing ViT (SV) designs a uniform ViT backbone, shared between depth estimation and segmentation branches; Depth Supervision (DS) makes use of depth prediction as an auxiliary training guide for feature learning. Though DS exhibits limited effectiveness, benchmark evaluations demonstrate that EDC and SV significantly enhance the robustness of VIS. When with Swin-L backbone, our EDC method gets 56.2 AP, which sets a new state-of-the-art result on OVIS benchmark. This work conclusively establishes depth cues as critical enablers for robust video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 Workshop LSVOS</p></details> |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

In practice, human teachers rely heavily on subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment instruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

For these, models can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over 4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy, but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model, GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.</p></details> | Technical report |

Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeVLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14049v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle. This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training \href{https://github.com/kscalelabs/evla }{codebase} to foster further research.</p></details> |  |

We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications.

Knowledge conflicts can result in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.</p></details> |  |

However, existing RS-VLMs are mostly limited to image-level and region-level tasks, lacking the capability to handle pixel-level tasks and performing poorly in small-object recognition scenarios. Moreover, RS-VLMs consume significant computational resources when processing high-resolution RS images, further restricting their practical applicability. In this context, we propose GeoMag (Geographical Magnifier), an end-to-end general-purpose large model framework for RS. GeoMag dynamically focuses the attention scope based on prompt semantics to effectively perform remote sensing image parsing across multiple levels of granularity. This method introduces Task-driven Multi-granularity Resolution Adjustment (TMRA) and Prompt-guided Semantic-aware Cropping (PSC), which adaptively reduce the spatial resolution of task-irrelevant regions while enhancing the visual representation of task-relevant areas. This approach improves the model's perception of critical target regions, suppresses background redundancy, and reduces the computational cost of interpreting high-resolution RS imagery. Extensive comparative experiments on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that GeoMag not only excels in handling pixel-level tasks but also maintains competitive performance across tasks of other granularities compared to existing RS-VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Modality Gap: Towards a Remote Sensing Vision-Language Model via Cross-modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09816v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) is undergoing a paradigm shift with the emergence of foundation models. In this work, we focus on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a Vision-Language foundation model that achieves high accuracy across various image classification tasks and often rivals fully supervised baselines, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. Nevertheless, there are still domains where zero-shot CLIP performance is far from optimal, such as Remote Sensing (RS) and medical imagery. These domains do not only exhibit fundamentally different distributions compared to natural images, but also commonly rely on complementary modalities, beyond RGB, to derive meaningful insights. To this end, we propose a methodology to align distinct RS image modalities with the visual and textual modalities of CLIP. Our two-stage procedure addresses the aforementioned distribution shift, extends the zero-shot capabilities of CLIP and enriches CLIP's shared embedding space with domain-specific knowledge. Initially, we robustly fine-tune CLIP according to the PAINT (Ilharco et al., 2022) patching protocol, in order to deal with the distribution shift. Building upon this foundation, we facilitate the cross-modal alignment of a RS modality encoder by distilling knowledge from the CLIP visual and textual encoders. We empirically show that both patching and cross-modal alignment translate to significant performance gains, across several RS imagery classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmark datasets. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without the reliance on textual descriptions, without introducing any task-specific parameters, without training from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting.

Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios.</p></details> | ACL2025 Main |

The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks, including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights ZonUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

| **[LoRA-Loop: Closing the Synthetic Replay Cycle for Continual VLM Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13568v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13348v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method.

Recently, vision-language models (VLM) based attacks have shown superior transferability by attacking generalized image and textual features of VLM, but they lack comprehensive feature disruption due to the overemphasis on discriminative semantics in integral representation. In this paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings, trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that AP-Attack achieves state-of-the-art transferability, significantly outperforming previous methods by 22.9% on mean Drop Rate in cross-model&dataset attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Language Prior for Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13113v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities. Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images, employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset of the LangIR dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23114v4)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR 2025.

| **[GLAD: Generalizable Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13089v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning, severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution. Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 workshop |

In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Complex Wide-Area Scene Understanding with Hierarchical Coresets Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13061v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories, and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density. HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaViPlan : Language-Guided Visual Path Planning with RLVR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12911v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, high-quality vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation). Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.</p></details> |  |

We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency.

These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Adaptive Foundation Models</p></details> |

Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented as a poster at MMFM 2025</p></details> |

To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model.

Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities.

These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution.

To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided.

| **[Analysis of Image-and-Text Uncertainty Propagation in Multimodal Large Language Models with Cardiac MR-Based Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12945v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However, interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning, along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.</p></details> | <details><summary>It is...</summary><p>It is accepted by 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[MCoT-RE: Multi-Faceted Chain-of-Thought and Re-Ranking for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12819v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text, without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics</p></details> |
| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v6)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think-Before-Draw: Decomposing Emotion Semantics & Fine-Grained Controllable Expressive Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12761v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence, with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our model's zero-shot generation capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToDMA: Large Model-Driven Token-Domain Multiple Access for Semantic Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10946v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE journals</p></details> |
| **[JailDAM: Jailbreak Detection with Adaptive Memory for Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03770v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mono-InternVL-1.5: Towards Cheaper and Faster Monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12566v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model. Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Sentence-Level Early Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12455v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL** (**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/pspdada/SENTINEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Value of Visual Input: A Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language Models for Robotic Path Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12391v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 SICE Festival with Annual Conference (SICE FES)</p></details> |
| **[Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10432v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |
