| **[Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[VADER: Towards Causal Video Anomaly Understanding with Relation-Aware Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07299v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to provide detailed interpretation and semantic comprehension of anomalous events within videos, addressing limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on detecting and localizing anomalies. However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobustA: Robust Anomaly Detection in Multimodal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07276v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal anomaly detection methods have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements over video-only models. However, real-world multimodal data is often corrupted due to unforeseen environmental distortions. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work that comprehensively investigates the adverse effects of corrupted modalities on multimodal anomaly detection task. To streamline this work, we propose RobustA, a carefully curated evaluation dataset to systematically observe the impacts of audio and visual corruptions on the overall effectiveness of anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal anomaly detection method, which shows notable resilience against corrupted modalities. The proposed method learns a shared representation space for different modalities and employs a dynamic weighting scheme during inference based on the estimated level of corruption. Our work represents a significant step forward in enabling the real-world application of multimodal anomaly detection, addressing situations where the likely events of modality corruptions occur. The proposed evaluation dataset with corrupted modalities and respective extracted features will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Towards Personalized Quantum Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07471v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |
| **[M2S2L: Mamba-based Multi-Scale Spatial-temporal Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05564v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.</p></details> | IEEE VCIP 2025 |
| **[A Unified Reasoning Framework for Holistic Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00962v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training. Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding, yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection, localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in a fully zero-shot manner.

| **[CueBench: Advancing Unified Understanding of Context-Aware Video Anomalies in Real-World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00613v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How far are deep models from real-world video anomaly understanding (VAU)? Current works typically emphasize on detecting unexpected occurrences deviated from normal patterns or comprehending anomalous events with interpretable descriptions. However, they exhibit only a superficial comprehension of real-world anomalies, with limited breadth in complex principles and subtle context that distinguish the anomalies from normalities, e.g., climbing cliffs with safety gear vs. without it. To this end, we introduce CueBench, the first of its kind Benchmark, devoted to Context-aware video anomalies within a Unified Evaluation framework. We comprehensively establish an event-centric hierarchical taxonomy that anchors two core event types: 14 conditional and 18 absolute anomaly events, defined by their refined semantics from diverse contexts across 174 scenes and 198 attributes. Based on this, we propose to unify and benchmark context-aware VAU with various challenging tasks across recognition, temporal grounding, detection, and anticipation. This also serves as a rigorous and fair probing evaluation suite for generative-discriminative as well as generalized-specialized vision-language models (VLMs). To address the challenges underlying CueBench, we further develop Cue-R1 based on R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable, task-aligned, and hierarchy-refined rewards in a unified generative manner. Extensive results on CueBench reveal that, existing VLMs are still far from satisfactory real-world anomaly understanding, while our Cue-R1 surpasses these state-of-the-art approaches by over 24% on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACES: Temporal Recall with Contextual Embeddings for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00580v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context, which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve 90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process Integrated Computer Vision for Real-Time Failure Prediction in Steel Rolling Mill](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26684v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources. By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection under Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask may be considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly scores. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detector), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions under weak supervision with two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate LaGoVAD's SOTA performance. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/Kamino666/LaGoVAD-PreVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/PANDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTFL: Multi-Timescale Feature Learning for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05900v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of anomaly events is relevant for public safety and requires a combination of fine-grained motion information and contextual events at variable time-scales. To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Human-Centric Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos Using YOLO-World and Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22056v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World - an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking. Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials, with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages - demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Blind and Low-Vision Accessibility of Lightweight VLMs and Custom LLM-Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10615v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Recent transformer-based single-image monocular depth estimation models perform well on single images but struggle with depth consistency across video frames. Traditional methods aim to improve temporal consistency using multi-frame temporal modules or prior information like optical flow and camera parameters. However, these approaches face issues such as high memory use, reduced performance with dynamic or irregular motion, and limited motion understanding. We propose STATIC, a novel model that independently learns temporal consistency in static and dynamic area without additional information. A difference mask from surface normals identifies static and dynamic area by measuring directional variance. For static area, the Masked Static (MS) module enhances temporal consistency by focusing on stable regions. For dynamic area, the Surface Normal Similarity (SNS) module aligns areas and enhances temporal consistency by measuring feature similarity between frames. A final refinement integrates the independently learned static and dynamic area, enabling STATIC to achieve temporal consistency across the entire sequence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art video depth estimation on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets without additional information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is being withdrawn because we have identified a significant error in the implementation of our self-supervised clustering approach.

To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.</p></details> |  |

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> |

The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. However, building a trainable sampling method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling in Video-MLLMs. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization for the temporal sampling policy. Furthermore, we propose a dual-style long video training data construction pipeline, balancing comprehensive temporal understanding and key segment localization. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

The goal in EgoTV is to verify the execution of tasks from egocentric videos based on the natural language description of these tasks. EgoTV contains pairs of videos and their task descriptions for multi-step tasks -- these tasks contain multiple sub-task decompositions, state changes, object interactions, and sub-task ordering constraints. In addition, EgoTV also provides abstracted task descriptions that contain only partial details about ways to accomplish a task. Consequently, EgoTV requires causal, temporal, and compositional reasoning of video and language modalities, which is missing in existing datasets. We also find that existing vision-language models struggle at such all round reasoning needed for task verification in EgoTV. Inspired by the needs of EgoTV, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Grounding (NSG) approach that leverages symbolic representations to capture the compositional and temporal structure of tasks. We demonstrate NSG's capability towards task tracking and verification on our EgoTV dataset and a real-world dataset derived from CrossTask (CTV). We open-source the EgoTV and CTV datasets and the NSG model for future research on egocentric assistive agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2023</p></details> |

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

To understand these failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge. Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input. These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this, we explore integrating spatio-temporal specific rewards into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address the unique challenges of video understanding, such as long-range temporal associations. This paper investigates how rule-based rewards, particularly temporal ones, can improve video reasoning and their generalizability. Our study proposes Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) as a data-efficient method to enhance video reasoning on specific tasks without sacrificing original capabilities. Through joint RFT on multiple spatio-temporal perception tasks, we developed VideoChat-R1, a powerful Video MLLM. VideoChat-R1 achieves state-of-the-art spatio-temporal perception, demonstrating significant improvements in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2), while also improving general QA benchmarks. The enhanced perception and preserved chat abilities contribute to a more reliable video dialogue system, leading to our ``Temporal Clue-driven Reasoning" inference schema. This work provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world video comprehension agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready for EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> |

The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing benchmark datasets primarily focus on single, short (\eg, minutes to tens of minutes) to moderately long videos, leaving a substantial gap in evaluating extensive, ultra-long egocentric video recordings. To address this, we introduce X-LeBench, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to fill this gap by focusing on tasks requiring a comprehensive understanding of extremely long egocentric video recordings. Our X-LeBench develops a life-logging simulation pipeline that produces realistic, coherent daily plans aligned with real-world video data. This approach enables the flexible integration of synthetic daily plans with real-world footage from Ego4D-a massive-scale egocentric video dataset covers a wide range of daily life scenarios-resulting in 432 simulated video life logs spanning from 23 minutes to 16.4 hours. The evaluations of several baseline systems and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal their poor performance across the board, highlighting the inherent challenges of long-form egocentric video understanding, such as temporal localization and reasoning, context aggregation, and memory retention, and underscoring the need for more advanced models.</p></details> |  |

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</p></details> |  |

To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://livioni.github.io/OmniVGGT-offcial/</p></details> |

Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Creative AI Track</p></details> |
| **[SemanticVLA: Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10518v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral), Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA</p></details> |

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more resilient approaches in the GenAI era.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Residual-Update Steering for Low-Overhead Hallucination Mitigation in Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10292v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.</p></details> | Under review |

Its progress is limited by the lack of standardized datasets and robust models, as the temporal dynamics of video and multimodal fusion challenges hinder direct application of image-based methods. This study introduces VADB, the largest video aesthetic database with 10,490 diverse videos annotated by 37 professionals across multiple aesthetic dimensions, including overall and attribute-specific aesthetic scores, rich language comments and objective tags. We propose VADB-Net, a dual-modal pre-training framework with a two-stage training strategy, which outperforms existing video quality assessment models in scoring tasks and supports downstream video aesthetic assessment tasks.

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

| **[Causal-HalBench: Uncovering LVLMs Object Hallucinations Through Causal Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10268v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, making erroneous judgments about the presence of objects in images. We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias. To quantify the influence induced by these spurious correla- tions, we develop Causal-HalBench, a benchmark specifically constructed with counterfactual samples and integrated with comprehensive causal metrics designed to assess model ro- bustness against spurious correlations. Concurrently, we pro- pose an extensible pipeline for the construction of these coun- terfactual samples, leveraging the capabilities of proprietary LVLMs and Text-to-Image (T2I) models for their genera- tion. Our evaluations on mainstream LVLMs using Causal- HalBench demonstrate these models exhibit susceptibility to spurious correlations, albeit to varying extents.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic ADMM for Deep Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10784v4)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of foundation models (FMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, revolutionizing various sectors worldwide. The popular optimizers used to train these models are stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms, which face inherent limitations, such as slow convergence and stringent assumptions for convergence. In particular, data heterogeneity arising from distributed settings poses significant challenges to their theoretical and numerical performance. This paper develops an algorithm, PISA (Preconditioned Inexact Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers). Grounded in rigorous theoretical guarantees, the algorithm converges under the sole assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on a bounded region, thereby removing the need for other conditions commonly imposed by stochastic methods. This capability enables the proposed algorithm to tackle the challenge of data heterogeneity effectively. Moreover, the algorithmic architecture enables scalable parallel computing and supports various preconditions, such as second-order information, second moment, and orthogonalized momentum by Newton-Schulz iterations. Incorporating the latter two preconditions in PISA yields two computationally efficient variants: SISA and NSISA. Comprehensive experimental evaluations for training or fine-tuning diverse deep models, including vision models, large language models, reinforcement learning models, generative adversarial networks, and recurrent neural networks, demonstrate superior numerical performance of SISA and NSISA compared to various state-of-the-art optimizers.</p></details> |  |

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026. 16 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remodeling Semantic Relationships in Vision-Language Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08238v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.</p></details> |  |

However, popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent advancements have explored optimization-based and learning-based layer-wise image vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://layerpeeler.github.io/</p></details> |

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)</p></details> |

As workers perform complex tasks guided by AR and VR, these devices capture rich streams of multimodal data, including gaze, hand actions, and task progression, that can reveal user intent and task state in real time. Leveraging this information effectively remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a context-aware large language model (LLM) assistant that integrates diverse data modalities, such as hand actions, task steps, and dialogue history, into a unified framework for real-time question answering. To systematically study how context influences performance, we introduce an incremental prompting framework, where each model version receives progressively richer contextual inputs. Using the HoloAssist dataset, which records AR-guided task executions, we evaluate how each modality contributes to the assistant's effectiveness. Our experiments show that incorporating multimodal context significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of responses. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven multimodal integration to enable adaptive, intuitive assistance for AR and VR-based industrial training and assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is intended for submission to the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly available to foster future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech-Audio Compositional Attacks on Multimodal LLMs and Their Mitigation with SALMONN-Guard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10222v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled understanding of both speech and non-speech audio, but exposing new safety risks emerging from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition mechanisms. SACRED-Bench adopts three mechanisms: (a) speech overlap and multi-speaker dialogue, which embeds harmful prompts beneath or alongside benign speech; (b) speech-audio mixture, which imply unsafe intent via non-speech audio alongside benign speech or audio; and (c) diverse spoken instruction formats (open-ended QA, yes/no) that evade text-only filters. Experiments show that, even Gemini 2.5 Pro, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM, still exhibits 66% attack success rate in SACRED-Bench test set, exposing vulnerabilities under cross-modal, speech-audio composition attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, a safeguard LLM that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing attack success down to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses for the safety of multimodal LLMs. The benchmark and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.

| **[An Efficient Training Pipeline for Reasoning Graphical User Interface Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08172v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought-augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does My Model Fail? Automatic Identification and Interpretation of Physical Plausibility Failure Modes with Matryoshka Transcoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10094v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Opinion: Towards Unified Expressive Policy Optimization for Robust Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10087v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (O2O-RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for safe and efficient robotic policy deployment but suffers from two fundamental challenges: limited coverage of multimodal behaviors and distributional shifts during online adaptation. We propose UEPO, a unified generative framework inspired by large language model pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a multi-seed dynamics-aware diffusion policy that efficiently captures diverse modalities without training multiple models; (2) a dynamic divergence regularization mechanism that enforces physically meaningful policy diversity; and (3) a diffusion-based data augmentation module that enhances dynamics model generalization. On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Embodied World Models for Decision Making</p></details> |
| **[GridPrune: From "Where to Look" to "What to Select" in Visual Token Pruning for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10081v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Format Matters: The Robustness of Multimodal LLMs in Reviewing Evidence from Tables and Charts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10075v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Aligning MLLM Benchmark With Human Preferences via Structural Equation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21572v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is fundamentally challenged by the absence of structured, interpretable, and theoretically grounded benchmarks; current heuristically-grouped tasks have vague cognitive targets, overlapping abilities, redundant indicators, and weak diagnostic power. We therefore propose a structural-equation-modeling-aligned framework that quantifies internal validity, dimensional separability, and component contributions, and introduce a Piaget-inspired capability hierarchy that stratifies MLLM abilities into Perception, Memory, and Reasoning. Reorganizing existing tasks under this theory, we build the GOLD benchmark, whose experiments show superior interpretability, lower indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency than prior benchmarks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[When Eyes and Ears Disagree: Can MLLMs Discern Audio-Visual Confusion?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10059v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

| **[Image Aesthetic Reasoning via HCM-GRPO: Empowering Compact Model for Superior Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10055v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Language Models Associate Sound with Meaning? A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 27 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Anomagic: Crossmodal Prompt-driven Zero-shot Anomaly Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10020v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.</p></details> |  |
