| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection models aim to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask is considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly score. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world VAD), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions through two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide given labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate SOTA performance. Data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[UCF-Crime-DVS: A Novel Event-Based Dataset for Video Anomaly Detection with Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12905v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection plays a significant role in intelligent surveillance systems. To enhance model's anomaly recognition ability, previous works have typically involved RGB, optical flow, and text features. Recently, dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have emerged as a promising technology, which capture visual information as discrete events with a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. It reduces data redundancy and enhances the capture capacity of moving objects compared to conventional camera. To introduce this rich dynamic information into the surveillance field, we created the first DVS video anomaly detection benchmark, namely UCF-Crime-DVS. To fully utilize this new data modality, a multi-scale spiking fusion network (MSF) is designed based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). This work explores the potential application of dynamic information from event data in video anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on UCF-Crime-DVS and its superior performance compared to other models, establishing a new baseline for SNN-based weakly supervised video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Structured Keywords](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10653v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in surveillance video using keywords by leveraging foundational models' feature representation generalization capabilities. We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Impossible Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14378v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic videos nowadays is widely used to complement data scarcity and diversity of real-world videos. Current synthetic datasets primarily replicate real-world scenarios, leaving impossible, counterfactual and anti-reality video concepts underexplored. This work aims to answer two questions: 1) Can today's video generation models effectively follow prompts to create impossible video content? 2) Are today's video understanding models good enough for understanding impossible videos? To this end, we introduce IPV-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate and foster progress in video understanding and generation. IPV-Bench is underpinned by a comprehensive taxonomy, encompassing 4 domains, 14 categories. It features diverse scenes that defy physical, biological, geographical, or social laws. Based on the taxonomy, a prompt suite is constructed to evaluate video generation models, challenging their prompt following and creativity capabilities. In addition, a video benchmark is curated to assess Video-LLMs on their ability of understanding impossible videos, which particularly requires reasoning on temporal dynamics and world knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations reveal limitations and insights for future directions of video models, paving the way for next-generation video models.</p></details> | 26 pages |

The existing video retrieval and caption benchmarks only include short descriptions, limits their ability of detailed video understanding evaluation. To address this problem, we present CaReBench, a testing benchmark for fine-grained video captioning and retrieval with 1,000 high-quality pairs of videos and human-annotated detailed captions. Uniquely, it provides manually separated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video. Based on this design, we introduce two evaluation metrics, ReBias and CapST, specifically tailored for video retrieval and video captioning tasks, respectively. These metrics enable a comprehensive investigation into the spatial and temporal biases inherent in VLMs. In addition, to handle both video retrieval and video captioning tasks in a unified framework, we develop a simple baseline based on a Multimodal Language Model (MLLM). By implementing a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we fully unlock the potential of MLLM, enabling it not only to generate detailed video descriptions but also to extract video features. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the CLIP-based models designed for retrieval and the popular MLLMs skilled in video captioning, our baseline shows competitive performance in both fine-grained video retrieval and video detailed captioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Action Recognition in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21113v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for surveillance in public spaces presents significant challenges due to the shortage of human resources. Current AI-based video surveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require extensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings due to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.). In this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known for their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video understanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a state-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method, Self-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset show that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance, with 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot action recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential of LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance video analysis in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

| **[Improving LLM Video Understanding with 16 Frames Per Second](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13956v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. Upon acceptance, we will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable Modeling of Compressed Videos for Efficient Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13724v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust deep video representations has proven to be computationally challenging due to substantial decoding overheads, the enormous size of raw video streams, and their inherent high temporal redundancy. Different from existing schemes, operating exclusively in the compressed video domain and exploiting all freely available modalities, i.e., I-frames, and P-frames (motion vectors and residuals) offers a compute-efficient alternative. Existing methods approach this task as a naive multi-modality problem, ignoring the temporal correlation and implicit sparsity across P-frames for modeling stronger shared representations for videos of the same action, making training and generalization easier. By revisiting the high-level design of dominant video understanding backbones, we increase inference speed by a factor of $56$ while retaining similar performance. For this, we propose a hybrid end-to-end framework that factorizes learning across three key concepts to reduce inference cost by $330\times$ versus prior art: First, a specially designed dual-encoder scheme with efficient Spiking Temporal Modulators to minimize latency while retaining cross-domain feature aggregation. Second, a unified transformer model to capture inter-modal dependencies using global self-attention to enhance I-frame -- P-frame contextual interactions. Third, a Multi-Modal Mixer Block to model rich representations from the joint spatiotemporal token embeddings. Experiments show that our method results in a lightweight architecture achieving state-of-the-art video recognition performance on UCF-101, HMDB-51, K-400, K-600 and SS-v2 datasets with favorable costs ($0.73$J/V) and fast inference ($16$V/s). Our observations bring new insights into practical design choices for efficient next-generation spatiotemporal learners. Code is available.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional approaches demand substantial computing power and are often bottlenecked by GPU memory. To tackle this issue, we present Long-Video Memory Network, Long-VMNet, a novel video understanding method that employs a fixed-size memory representation to store discriminative patches sampled from the input video. Long-VMNet achieves improved efficiency by leveraging a neural sampler that identifies discriminative tokens. Additionally, Long-VMNet only needs one scan through the video, greatly boosting efficiency. Our results on the Rest-ADL dataset demonstrate an 18x -- 75x improvement in inference times for long-form video retrieval and answering questions, with a competitive predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videomind.github.io/</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been extensively explored. In the paper, we introduce Valley, a multi-modal foundation model that is designed to enable enhanced video comprehension and instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we construct two datasets, namely Valley-702k and Valley-instruct-73k, to cover a diverse range of video-text alignment and video-based instruction tasks, such as multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal inference, etc. Then, we adopt ViT-L/14 as the vision encoder and explore three different temporal modeling modules to learn multifaceted features for enhanced video understanding. In addition, we implement a two-phase training approach for Valley: the first phase focuses solely on training the projection module to facilitate the LLM's capacity to understand visual input, and the second phase jointly trains the projection module and the LLM to improve their instruction following ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Valley has the potential to serve as an effective video assistant, simplifying complex video-understanding scenarios.

| **[Logic-in-Frames: Dynamic Keyframe Search via Visual Semantic-Logical Verification for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13139v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to ``finding a needle in a haystack.'' To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning.

| **[Efficient Motion-Aware Video MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13016v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current video MLLMs rely on uniform frame sampling and image-level encoders, resulting in inefficient data processing and limited motion awareness. To address these challenges, we introduce EMA, an Efficient Motion-Aware video MLLM that utilizes compressed video structures as inputs. We propose a motion-aware GOP (Group of Pictures) encoder that fuses spatial and motion information within a GOP unit in the compressed video stream, generating compact, informative visual tokens. By integrating fewer but denser RGB frames with more but sparser motion vectors in this native slow-fast input architecture, our approach reduces redundancy and enhances motion representation. Additionally, we introduce MotionBench, a benchmark for evaluating motion understanding across four motion types: linear, curved, rotational, and contact-based. Experimental results show that EMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MotionBench and popular video question answering benchmarks, while reducing inference costs. Moreover, EMA demonstrates strong scalability, as evidenced by its competitive performance on long video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

| **[VideoScan: Enabling Efficient Streaming Video Understanding via Frame-level Semantic Carriers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09387v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VideoScan, an efficient vision-language model (VLM) inference framework designed for real-time video interaction that effectively comprehends and retains streamed video inputs while delivering rapid and accurate responses. A longstanding challenge in video understanding--particularly for long-term or real-time applications--stems from the substantial computational overhead caused by the extensive length of visual tokens. To address this, VideoScan employs a single semantic carrier token to represent each frame, progressively reducing computational and memory overhead during its two-phase inference process: prefilling and decoding. The embedding of the semantic carrier token is derived from an optimized aggregation of frame-level visual features, ensuring compact yet semantically rich representations. Critically, the corresponding key-value pairs are trained to retain contextual semantics from prior frames, enabling efficient memory management without sacrificing temporal coherence. During inference, the visual tokens of each frame are processed only once during the prefilling phase and subsequently discarded in the decoding stage, eliminating redundant computations. This design ensures efficient VLM inference even under stringent real-time constraints. Comprehensive experiments on diverse offline and online benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Video, supported by our method, achieves up to $\sim 5\times$ and $1.29\times$ speedups compared to its original version and previous efficient streaming video understanding approaches, respectively. Crucially, these improvements are attained while maintaining competitive performance and ensuring stable GPU memory consumption (consistently $\sim 18$GB, independent of video duration).</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Instead, streaming video understanding poses great challenges to recent models due to its time-sensitive, omni-modal and interactive characteristics. In this work, we aim to extend the streaming video understanding from a new perspective and propose a novel task named Visual Instruction Feedback in which models should be aware of visual contents and learn to extract instructions from them. For example, when users wave their hands to agents, agents should recognize the gesture and start conversations with welcome information. Thus, following instructions in visual modality greatly enhances user-agent interactions. To facilitate research, we define seven key subtasks highly relevant to visual modality and collect the ViSpeak-Instruct dataset for training and the ViSpeak-Bench for evaluation. Further, we propose the ViSpeak model, which is a SOTA streaming video understanding LMM with GPT-4o-level performance on various streaming video understanding benchmarks. After finetuning on our ViSpeak-Instruct dataset, ViSpeak is equipped with basic visual instruction feedback ability, serving as a solid baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench.

However, efficiently processing long videos remains a challenge due to the ``Sampling Dilemma'': low-density sampling risks missing critical information, while high-density sampling introduces redundancy. To address this issue, we introduce LSDBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LVLMs on long-video tasks by constructing high Necessary Sampling Density (NSD) questions, where NSD represents the minimum sampling density required to accurately answer a given question. LSDBench focuses on dense, short-duration actions to rigorously assess the sampling strategies employed by LVLMs. To tackle the challenges posed by high-NSD questions, we propose a novel Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Sampling (RHS) framework, which combines global localization of question-relevant cues with local dense sampling for precise inference. Additionally, we develop a lightweight Semantic-Guided Frame Selector to prioritize informative frames, enabling RHS to achieve comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer sampled frames. Together, our LSDBench and RHS framework address the unique challenges of high-NSD long-video tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating and improving LVLMs in this domain.</p></details> |  |

The presence of ubiquitous data imbalance hampers DNNs from effectively learning the underlying causal mechanisms, leading to significant performance drops when encountering distribution shifts, such as long-tail imbalances and perturbed imbalances. This realization has prompted researchers to seek alternative methodologies to capture causal patterns in video data. To tackle these challenges and increase the robustness of DNNs, causal modeling emerged as a principle to discover the true causal patterns behind the observed correlations. This thesis focuses on the domain of semantic video understanding and explores the potential of causal modeling to advance two fundamental tasks: Video Relation Detection (VidVRD) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA).</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

To overcome this challenge, we introduce VideoMAP, a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework featuring a novel pre-training approach. VideoMAP uses a 4:1 Mamba-to-Transformer ratio, effectively balancing computational cost and model capacity. This architecture, combined with our proposed frame-wise masked autoregressive pre-training strategy, delivers significant performance gains when scaling to larger models. Additionally, VideoMAP exhibits impressive sample efficiency, significantly outperforming existing methods with less training data. Experiments show that VideoMAP outperforms existing models across various datasets, including Kinetics-400, Something-Something V2, Breakfast, and COIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of VideoMAP as a visual encoder for multimodal large language models, highlighting its ability to reduce memory usage and enable the processing of longer video sequences.

However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts. Our novel dataset and code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV.</p></details> |  |

While this description is crucial for distinguishing the target from visually similar instances in a scene, providing it prior to navigation can be demanding for human. To bridge this gap, we introduce Collaborative Instance object Navigation (CoIN), a new task setting where the agent actively resolve uncertainties about the target instance during navigation in natural, template-free, open-ended dialogues with human. We propose a novel training-free method, Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness (AIUTA), which operates independently from the navigation policy, and focuses on the human-agent interaction reasoning with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). First, upon object detection, a Self-Questioner model initiates a self-dialogue within the agent to obtain a complete and accurate observation description with a novel uncertainty estimation technique. Then, an Interaction Trigger module determines whether to ask a question to the human, continue or halt navigation, minimizing user input. For evaluation, we introduce CoIN-Bench, with a curated dataset designed for challenging multi-instance scenarios. CoIN-Bench supports both online evaluation with humans and reproducible experiments with simulated user-agent interactions. On CoIN-Bench, we show that AIUTA serves as a competitive baseline, while existing language-driven instance navigation methods struggle in complex multi-instance scenes.

| **[Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review |

Current AI-based video surveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require extensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings due to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.). In this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known for their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video understanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a state-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method, Self-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset show that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance, with 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot action recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential of LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance video analysis in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSpace: Benchmarking Continuous Space Perception Ability for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14161v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently witnessed significant progress in visual comprehension. As the permitting length of image context grows, VLMs can now comprehend a broader range of views and spaces. Current benchmarks provide insightful analysis of VLMs in tasks involving complex visual instructions following, multi-image understanding and spatial reasoning. However, they usually focus on spatially irrelevant images or discrete images captured from varied viewpoints. The compositional characteristic of images captured from a static viewpoint remains underestimated. We term this characteristic as Continuous Space Perception. When observing a scene from a static viewpoint while shifting orientations, it produces a series of spatially continuous images, enabling the reconstruction of the entire space. In this paper, we present CoSpace, a multi-image visual understanding benchmark designed to assess the Continuous Space perception ability for VLMs. CoSpace contains 2,918 images and 1,626 question-answer pairs, covering seven types of tasks. We conduct evaluation across 19 proprietary and open-source VLMs. Results reveal that there exist pitfalls on the continuous space perception ability for most of the evaluated models, including proprietary ones. Interestingly, we find that the main discrepancy between open-source and proprietary models lies not in accuracy but in the consistency of responses. We believe that enhancing the ability of continuous space perception is essential for VLMs to perform effectively in real-world tasks and encourage further research to advance this capability.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we explore how to efficiently leverage class text information to mitigate these distribution drifts encountered by large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. In particular, we propose to generate pseudo-labels for the test-time samples by exploiting generic class text embeddings as fixed centroids of a label assignment problem, which is efficiently solved with Optimal Transport. Furthermore, the proposed adaptation method (CLIP-OT) integrates a multiple template knowledge distillation approach, which replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning but without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of CLIP-OT, achieving performance gains of up to 7% over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally and memory efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional figures to communicate the algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Growing a Twig to Accelerate Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14075v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-world multimodal understanding, yet their high computational overheads pose great challenges for practical deployment. Some recent works have proposed methods to accelerate VLMs by pruning redundant visual tokens guided by the attention maps of VLM's early layers. Despite the success of these token pruning methods, they still suffer from two major shortcomings: (i) considerable accuracy drop due to insensitive attention signals in early layers, and (ii) limited speedup when generating long responses (e.g., 30 tokens). To address the limitations above, we present TwigVLM -- a simple and general architecture by growing a lightweight twig upon an early layer of the base VLM. Compared with most existing VLM acceleration methods purely based on visual token pruning, our TwigVLM not only achieves better accuracy retention by employing a twig-guided token pruning (TTP) strategy, but also yields higher generation speed by utilizing a self-speculative decoding (SSD) strategy. Taking LLaVA-1.5-7B as the base VLM, experimental results show that TwigVLM preserves 96% of the original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens and achieves 154% speedup in generating long responses, delivering significantly better performance in terms of both accuracy and speed over the state-of-the-art VLM acceleration methods.

However, these models often struggle with continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks. As an effective remedy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, rehearsal strategy uses the data of past tasks upon learning new task. However, such strategy incurs the need of storing past data, which might not be feasible due to hardware constraints or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose the first data-free method that leverages the language generation capability of a VLM, instead of relying on external models, to produce pseudo-rehearsal data for addressing continual VQA. Our proposal, named as GaB, generates pseudo-rehearsal data by posing previous task questions on new task data. Yet, despite being effective, the distribution of generated questions skews towards the most frequently posed questions due to the limited and task-specific training data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a pseudo-rehearsal balancing module that aligns the generated data towards the ground-truth data distribution using either the question meta-statistics or an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate our proposed method on two recent benchmarks, \ie VQACL-VQAv2 and CLOVE-function benchmarks. GaB outperforms all the data-free baselines with substantial improvement in maintaining VQA performance across evolving tasks, while being on-par with methods with access to the past data.</p></details> |  |

While chain-of-thought prompting enables large language models to leverage reasoning effectively, harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging. To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-distillation framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of the model. The proposed framework introduces several key innovations. We start by employing a prompt library tailored to visual reasoning tasks to generate diverse in-context questions and utilize a two-step reasoning procedure to derive reasoning-guided responses. These responses are then used for self-distillation, enabling the model to internalize the reasoning process. Additionally, we improve the model architecture with several innovative components, including an intervention adapter for efficient parameter updates, a cross-modal skip connection to facilitate information exchange between modalities, and an ensemble learning algorithm to integrate diverse reasoning from multiple in-context questions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the baseline performance across five VQA datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISCO: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Critique and Correction Towards Self-Improvement in Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02172v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to critique and correct their reasoning is an essential building block towards their self-improvement. However, a systematic analysis of such capabilities in LVLMs is still lacking. We propose VISCO, the first benchmark to extensively analyze the fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs. Compared to existing work that uses a single scalar value to critique the entire reasoning [4], VISCO features dense and fine-grained critique, requiring LVLMs to evaluate the correctness of each step in the chain-of-thought and provide natural language explanations to support their judgments. Extensive evaluation of 24 LVLMs demonstrates that human-written critiques significantly enhance the performance after correction, showcasing the potential of the self-improvement strategy. However, the model-generated critiques are less helpful and sometimes detrimental to the performance, suggesting that critique is the crucial bottleneck. We identified three common patterns in critique failures: failure to critique visual perception, reluctance to "say no", and exaggerated assumption of error propagation. To address these issues, we propose an effective LookBack strategy that revisits the image to verify each piece of information in the initial reasoning. LookBack significantly improves critique and correction performance by up to 13.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. https://visco-benchmark.github.io/</p></details> |

To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method.

Notably, the emerging Mamba-2 has demonstrated competitive performance, bridging the gap between RNN models and transformers. However, due to sequential processing and vanishing gradients, RNN models struggle to capture long-range dependencies, limiting contextual understanding. This results in slow convergence, high resource demands, and poor performance on downstream understanding and complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we present a hybrid model MaTVLM by substituting a portion of the transformer decoder layers in a pre-trained VLM with Mamba-2 layers. Leveraging the inherent relationship between attention and Mamba-2, we initialize Mamba-2 with corresponding attention weights to accelerate convergence. Subsequently, we employ a single-stage distillation process, using the pre-trained VLM as the teacher model to transfer knowledge to the MaTVLM, further enhancing convergence speed and performance. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of differential distillation loss within our training framework. We evaluate the MaTVLM on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the teacher model and existing VLMs while surpassing both Mamba-based VLMs and models of comparable parameter scales. Remarkably, the MaTVLM achieves up to 3.6x faster inference than the teacher model while reducing GPU memory consumption by 27.5%, all without compromising performance.

Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of our MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information.

While recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise for holistic scene understanding, the application of VLMs to traffic scenarios, particularly using BEV maps, remains under explored. Existing methods often suffer from limited task design and narrow data amount, hindering comprehensive scene understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatBEV-QA, a novel BEV VQA benchmark contains over 137k questions, designed to encompass a wide range of scene understanding tasks, including global scene understanding, vehicle-lane interactions, and vehicle-vehicle interactions. This benchmark is constructed using an novel data collection pipeline that generates scalable and informative VQA data for BEV maps. We further fine-tune a specialized vision-language model ChatBEV, enabling it to interpret diverse question prompts and extract relevant context-aware information from BEV maps. Additionally, we propose a language-driven traffic scene generation pipeline, where ChatBEV facilitates map understanding and text-aligned navigation guidance, significantly enhancing the generation of realistic and consistent traffic scenarios.

Medical reasoning tasks demand robust image analysis and well-justified answers, posing challenges due to the complexity of medical images. Transparency and trustworthiness are essential for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. We introduce Med-R1, a framework exploring reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance VLMs' generalizability and trustworthiness in medical reasoning. Leveraging the DeepSeek strategy, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to guide reasoning paths via reward signals. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often overfits and lacks generalization, RL fosters robust and diverse reasoning. Med-R1 is evaluated across eight medical imaging modalities: CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Dermoscopy, Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Microscopy, and X-ray Imaging. Compared to its base model, Qwen2-VL-2B, Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% accuracy improvement and outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B, which has 36 times more parameters. Testing across five question types-modality recognition, anatomy identification, disease diagnosis, lesion grading, and biological attribute analysis Med-R1 demonstrates superior generalization, exceeding Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% and surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B in question-type generalization. These findings show that RL improves medical reasoning and enables parameter-efficient models to outperform significantly larger ones. With interpretable reasoning outputs, Med-R1 represents a promising step toward generalizable, trustworthy, and clinically viable medical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, their visual understanding behaviors remain underexplored. A fundamental question arises: to what extent do LVLMs rely on visual input, and which image regions contribute to their responses? It is non-trivial to interpret the free-form generation of LVLMs due to their complicated visual architecture (e.g., multiple encoders and multi-resolution) and variable-length outputs. In this paper, we extend existing heatmap visualization methods (e.g., iGOS++) to support LVLMs for open-ended visual question answering. We propose a method to select visually relevant tokens that reflect the relevance between generated answers and input image. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art LVLMs on benchmarks designed to require visual information to answer. Our findings offer several insights into LVLM behavior, including the relationship between focus region and answer correctness, differences in visual attention across architectures, and the impact of LLM scale on visual understanding.

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in various autonomous driving tasks, they often suffer from limitations such as inadequate spatial perception and hallucination, reducing their effectiveness in complex autonomous driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented decision-making (RAD) framework, a novel architecture designed to enhance VLMs' capabilities to reliably generate meta-actions in autonomous driving scenes. RAD leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically improve decision accuracy through a three-stage process consisting of the embedding flow, retrieving flow, and generating flow. Additionally, we fine-tune VLMs on a specifically curated dataset derived from the NuScenes dataset to enhance their spatial perception and bird's-eye view image comprehension capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations on the curated NuScenes-based dataset demonstrate that RAD outperforms baseline methods across key evaluation metrics, including match accuracy, and F1 score, and self-defined overall score, highlighting its effectiveness in improving meta-action decision-making for autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution-based Region Adversarial Prompt Learning for Robustness Enhancement in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12874v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Previous work has explored robust text prompts through adversarial training, achieving some improvement in both robustness and generalization. However, they primarily rely on singlegradient direction perturbations (e.g., PGD) to generate AEs, which lack diversity, resulting in limited improvement in adversarial robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an evolution-based region adversarial prompt tuning method called ER-APT, which combines gradient methods with genetic evolution to generate more diverse and challenging AEs. In each training iteration, we first generate AEs using traditional gradient-based methods. Subsequently, a genetic evolution mechanism incorporating selection, mutation, and crossover is applied to optimize the AEs, ensuring a broader and more aggressive perturbation distribution.The final evolved AEs are used for prompt tuning, achieving region-based adversarial optimization instead of conventional single-point adversarial prompt tuning. We also propose a dynamic loss weighting method to adjust prompt learning efficiency for accuracy and robustness. Experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, outperforming stateof-the-art APT methods.

In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional modules to capture temporal information. Although the additional modules increase the capacity of model, enabling it to better capture video-specific inductive biases, existing methods typically introduce a substantial number of new parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to enhance the alignment between textual and visual representations, achieving a balance between generalizable knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint.This constraint involves providing template inputs (e.g., "a video of \{\textbf{cls}\}") to the trainable language branch and LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions to the pre-trained language branch, enforcing output consistency between the branches. This approach reduces overfitting to downstream tasks and enhances the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms. This work seeks to help researchers organize current advancements in the field and inspire better alignment methods.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions due to the extremely high cost of collecting chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data for improving reasoning. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, the outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description, an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding, ensuring greater comprehensiveness and accuracy. Additionally, we adopt a structured CoT reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, with merely 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

Given the extensive applications of MLLMs, the associated safety issues have become increasingly critical. Due to the effectiveness of preference optimization in aligning MLLMs with human preferences, there is an urgent need for safety-related preference data for MLLMs. To address this, we construct the MMSafe-PO preference dataset towards harmless multimodal assistants, featuring multimodal instructions, the conversational format, and ranked paired responses from human feedback. We also identify two insightful observations: modality co-defense and modality cheating, which illustrate that MLLMs possess a certain level of inherent defense while still presenting unique safety challenges. Based on these observations, we propose the Blind Preference Optimization (BPO) approach. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks show that BPO effectively enhances the safety capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, BPO significantly improves the safety rate of the base MLLM by 45.0%, outperforming the DPO approach. Additionally, applying BPO to the MMSafe-PO dataset greatly reduces the base MLLM's unsafe rate on other safety benchmarks (14.5% on MM-SafetyBench and 82.9% on HarmEval, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of both the dataset and the approach.

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Adversarial Robustness in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13962v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in artificial intelligence by facilitating integrated understanding across diverse modalities, including text, images, video, audio, and speech. However, their deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns about adversarial vulnerabilities that could compromise their safety and reliability. Unlike unimodal models, MLLMs face unique challenges due to the interdependencies among modalities, making them susceptible to modality-specific threats and cross-modal adversarial manipulations. This paper reviews the adversarial robustness of MLLMs, covering different modalities. We begin with an overview of MLLMs and a taxonomy of adversarial attacks tailored to each modality. Next, we review key datasets and evaluation metrics used to assess the robustness of MLLMs. After that, we provide an in-depth review of attacks targeting MLLMs across different modalities. Our survey also identifies critical challenges and suggests promising future research directions.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Improving LLM Video Understanding with 16 Frames Per Second](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13956v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. Upon acceptance, we will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepPerception: Advancing R1-like Cognitive Visual Perception in MLLMs for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12797v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research. The data, codes, and models are released at https://github.com/thunlp/DeepPerception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Inference Adaptively for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10905v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13399v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

| **[3DAxisPrompt: Promoting the 3D Grounding and Reasoning in GPT-4o](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13185v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cornstarch: Distributed Multimodal Training Must Be Multimodality-Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11367v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by combining heterogeneous model architectures to handle diverse modalities like images and audio. However, this inherent heterogeneity in MLLM model structure and data types makes makeshift extensions to existing LLM training frameworks unsuitable for efficient MLLM training. In this paper, we present Cornstarch, the first general-purpose distributed MLLM training framework. Cornstarch facilitates modular MLLM construction, enables composable parallelization of constituent models, and introduces MLLM-specific optimizations to pipeline and context parallelism for efficient distributed MLLM training. Our evaluation shows that Cornstarch outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to $1.57\times$ in terms of training throughput. Cornstarch is an open-source project available at https://github.com/cornstarch-org/Cornstarch.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifting the Veil on Visual Information Flow in MLLMs: Unlocking Pathways to Faster Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13108v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) improve performance on vision-language tasks by integrating visual features from pre-trained vision encoders into large language models (LLMs). However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13107v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Cross-Modal Distraction and Ensuring Geometric Feasibility via Affordance-Guided, Self-Consistent MLLMs for Food Preparation Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13055v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with in-context learning for food preparation task planning. In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.</p></details> |  |
