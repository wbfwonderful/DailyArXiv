Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. We present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel Bogdoll and Jan Imhof contributed equally.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v6)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional performance in video anomaly detection (VAD). However, most systems remain black boxes, lacking explainability during training and inference. A key challenge is integrating explicit knowledge into implicit models to create expert-driven, interpretable VAD systems. This paper introduces Rule-based Violence Monitoring (RuleVM), a novel weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD) paradigm. RuleVM employs a dual-branch architecture: an implicit branch using visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, with feature extraction split into scene frames and action channels, and an explicit branch leveraging language-image alignment for fine-grained classification. The explicit branch utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for object detection in video frames, with association rules mined from data as video descriptors. This design enables interpretable coarse- and fine-grained violence monitoring. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show RuleVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both granularities. Notably, it reveals rules like increased violence risk with crowd size. Demo content is provided in the appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |

With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[VADMamba: Exploring State Space Models for Fast Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21169v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) methods are mostly CNN-based or Transformer-based, achieving impressive results, but the focus on detection accuracy often comes at the expense of inference speed. The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work. Code is available at https://github.com/jLooo/VADMamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Contours -- A Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19588v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection prior art is rooted on the assumption that abnormal events can be mostly regarded as a result of uncommon human behavior. Opposed to utilizing skeleton representations of humans, however, we investigate the potential of learning recurrent motion patterns of normal human behavior using 2D contours. Keeping all advantages of pose-based methods, such as increased object anonymization, the shift from human skeletons to contours is hypothesized to leave the opportunity to cover more object categories open for future research. We propose formulating the problem as a regression and a classification task, and additionally explore two distinct data representation techniques for contours. To further reduce the computational complexity of Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection solutions, all methods in this study are based on shallow Neural Networks from the field of Deep Learning, and evaluated on the three most prominent benchmark datasets within Video Anomaly Detection and their human-related counterparts, totaling six datasets. Our results indicate that this novel perspective on Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection marks a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18808v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Anomize: Better Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18094v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14329v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify human behaviors that deviate from normal. At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/HuVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection models aim to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask is considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly score. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world VAD), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions through two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide given labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate SOTA performance. Data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[UCF-Crime-DVS: A Novel Event-Based Dataset for Video Anomaly Detection with Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12905v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection plays a significant role in intelligent surveillance systems. To enhance model's anomaly recognition ability, previous works have typically involved RGB, optical flow, and text features. Recently, dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have emerged as a promising technology, which capture visual information as discrete events with a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. It reduces data redundancy and enhances the capture capacity of moving objects compared to conventional camera. To introduce this rich dynamic information into the surveillance field, we created the first DVS video anomaly detection benchmark, namely UCF-Crime-DVS. To fully utilize this new data modality, a multi-scale spiking fusion network (MSF) is designed based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). This work explores the potential application of dynamic information from event data in video anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on UCF-Crime-DVS and its superior performance compared to other models, establishing a new baseline for SNN-based weakly supervised video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |

| **[MASR: Self-Reflective Reasoning through Multimodal Hierarchical Attention Focusing for Agent-based Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17213v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding remains a highly challenging task. Compared to texts or images, videos commonly contain more information with redundancy, requiring large models to properly allocate attention at a global level for comprehensive and accurate understanding. To address this, we propose a Multimodal hierarchical Attention focusing Self-reflective Reasoning (MASR) framework for agent-based video understanding. The key innovation lies in its ability to detect and prioritize segments of videos that are highly relevant to the query. Firstly, MASR realizes Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Relevance Sensing (MCRS) which enhances the correlation between the acquired contextual information and the query. Secondly, MASR employs Dilated Temporal Expansion (DTE) to mitigate the risk of missing crucial details when extracting semantic information from the focused frames selected through MCRS. By iteratively applying MCRS and DTE in the self-reflective reasoning process, MASR is able to adaptively adjust the attention to extract highly query-relevant context and therefore improve the response accuracy. In the EgoSchema dataset, MASR achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over previous leading approaches. In the Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms the state-of-the-art standards by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. In the Video-MME dataset that contains long-term videos, MASR also performs better than other agent-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-XL-Pro: Reconstructive Token Compression for Extremely Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18478v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advanced token compression techniques, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with hour-long video understanding. In this work, we propose Video-XL-Pro, an efficient method for extremely long video understanding, built upon Reconstructive Compression of Tokens (ReCoT), a learnable module that leverages self-supervised learning to generate comprehensive and compact video tokens. ReCoT introduces two key components: (i) Dynamic Token Synthesizer (DTS): DTS generates pseudo-video tokens from static image tokens by learning intra-token relationships, which are then used in masked video modeling. (ii) Semantic-Guided Masking (SGM): SGM adaptively masks redundant visual tokens to facilitate more effective reconstructive learning. To improve training efficiency in MLLMs fine-tuning, we introduce a video-specific dataset pruning strategy and design a simple yet Query-aware Selector that enables the model to precisely locate query-relevant video tokens. With only 3B parameters, Video-XL-Pro outperforms most 7B models trained on larger datasets across multiple long video understanding benchmarks. Moreover, it can process over 8K frames on a single A100 GPU while maintaining high-quality performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoRoPE: What Makes for Good Video Rotary Position Embedding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05173v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and its variants are widely adopted for their long-context capabilities, the extension of the 1D RoPE to video, with its complex spatio-temporal structure, remains an open challenge. This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination. Our code will be available at \href{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods.

| **[ActionArt: Advancing Multimodal Large Models for Fine-Grained Human-Centric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18152v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained understanding of human actions and poses in videos is essential for human-centric AI applications. In this work, we introduce ActionArt, a fine-grained video-caption dataset designed to advance research in human-centric multimodal understanding. Our dataset comprises thousands of videos capturing a broad spectrum of human actions, human-object interactions, and diverse scenarios, each accompanied by detailed annotations that meticulously label every limb movement. We develop eight sub-tasks to evaluate the fine-grained understanding capabilities of existing large multimodal models across different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that, while current large multimodal models perform commendably on various tasks, they often fall short in achieving fine-grained understanding. We attribute this limitation to the scarcity of meticulously annotated data, which is both costly and difficult to scale manually. Since manual annotations are costly and hard to scale, we propose proxy tasks to enhance the model perception ability in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These proxy tasks are carefully crafted to be driven by data automatically generated from existing MLLMs, thereby reducing the reliance on costly manual labels. Experimental results show that the proposed proxy tasks significantly narrow the gap toward the performance achieved with manually annotated fine-grained data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSoccer: An End-to-End Multimodal Large Language Model for Soccer Commentary Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17365v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[HierarQ: Task-Aware Hierarchical Q-Former for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08585v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), current approaches struggle in medium-to-long video understanding due to frame and context length limitations. As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning: Enhancing Efficiency of Large Vision Language Models on Long-Form Video Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10742v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

These systems must process continuous video streams and respond to user queries instantaneously, presenting unique challenges for current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). While existing VideoLLMs excel at processing complete videos, they face significant limitations in streaming scenarios due to their inability to handle dense, redundant frames efficiently. We introduce TimeChat-Online, a novel online VideoLLM that revolutionizes real-time video interaction. At its core lies our innovative Differential Token Drop (DTD) module, which addresses the fundamental challenge of visual redundancy in streaming videos. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception's Change Blindness phenomenon, DTD preserves meaningful temporal changes while filtering out static, redundant content between frames. Remarkably, our experiments demonstrate that DTD achieves an 82.8% reduction in video tokens while maintaining 98% performance on StreamingBench, revealing that over 80% of visual content in streaming videos is naturally redundant without requiring language guidance. To enable seamless real-time interaction, we present TimeChat-Online-139K, a comprehensive streaming video dataset featuring diverse interaction patterns including backward-tracing, current-perception, and future-responding scenarios. TimeChat-Online's unique Proactive Response capability, naturally achieved through continuous monitoring of video scene transitions via DTD, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates TimeChat-Online's superior performance on streaming benchmarks (StreamingBench and OvOBench) and maintaining competitive results on long-form video tasks such as Video-MME and MLVU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vidi: Large Multimodal Models for Video Understanding and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15681v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[VEU-Bench: Towards Comprehensive Understanding of Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17828v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding (VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19 fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[DyMU: Dynamic Merging and Virtual Unmerging for Efficient VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17040v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

| **[Compositional 4D Dynamic Scenes Understanding with Physics Priors for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00622v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For vision-language models (VLMs), understanding the dynamic properties of objects and their interactions in 3D scenes from videos is crucial for effective reasoning about high-level temporal and action semantics. Although humans are adept at understanding these properties by constructing 3D and temporal (4D) representations of the world, current video understanding models struggle to extract these dynamic semantics, arguably because these models use cross-frame reasoning without underlying knowledge of the 3D/4D scenes. In this work, we introduce DynSuperCLEVR, the first video question answering dataset that focuses on language understanding of the dynamic properties of 3D objects. We concentrate on three physical concepts -- velocity, acceleration, and collisions within 4D scenes. We further generate three types of questions, including factual queries, future predictions, and counterfactual reasoning that involve different aspects of reasoning about these 4D dynamic properties. To further demonstrate the importance of explicit scene representations in answering these 4D dynamics questions, we propose NS-4DPhysics, a Neural-Symbolic VideoQA model integrating Physics prior for 4D dynamic properties with explicit scene representation of videos. Instead of answering the questions directly from the video text input, our method first estimates the 4D world states with a 3D generative model powered by physical priors, and then uses neural symbolic reasoning to answer the questions based on the 4D world states. Our evaluation on all three types of questions in DynSuperCLEVR shows that previous video question answering models and large multimodal models struggle with questions about 4D dynamics, while our NS-4DPhysics significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.

Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips. Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length. Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments. Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval. This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness. In practice, MR. Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce). MR. Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.

| **[ViSMaP: Unsupervised Hour-long Video Summarisation by Meta-Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15921v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision. Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones. These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos. Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos. We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose IV-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Image-Grounded Video Perception and Reasoning. IV-Bench consists of 967 videos paired with 2,585 meticulously annotated image-text queries across 13 tasks (7 perception and 6 reasoning tasks) and 5 representative categories. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open-source (e.g., InternVL2.5, Qwen2.5-VL) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini2-Flash and Gemini2-Pro) MLLMs demonstrate that current models substantially underperform in image-grounded video Perception and Reasoning, merely achieving at most 28.9% accuracy. Further analysis reveals key factors influencing model performance on IV-Bench, including inference pattern, frame number, and resolution. Additionally, through a simple data synthesis approach, we demonstratethe challenges of IV- Bench extend beyond merely aligning the data format in the training proecss. These findings collectively provide valuable insights for future research. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/IV-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Our work addresses the challenges in long video comprehension and high-resolution image understanding, introducing a generalist framework for both tasks. The proposed training framework incorporates Automatic Degrade Sampling and Image Area Preservation, two techniques that preserve contextual integrity and visual details. The framework also includes numerous efficiency optimizations in the pipeline for long-context data training. Finally, we propose Eagle-Video-110K, a novel dataset that integrates both story-level and clip-level annotations, facilitating long-video understanding. Eagle 2.5 demonstrates substantial improvements on long-context multimodal benchmarks, providing a robust solution to the limitations of existing VLMs. Notably, our best model Eagle 2.5-8B achieves 72.4% on Video-MME with 512 input frames, matching the results of top-tier commercial model such as GPT-4o and large-scale open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B.</p></details> |  |

This paper present \textbf{Quicksviewer}, an LMM with new perceiving paradigm that partitions a video of nonuniform density into varying cubes using Gumbel Softmax, followed by a unified resampling for each cube to achieve efficient video understanding. This simple and intuitive approach dynamically compress video online based on its temporal density, significantly reducing spatiotemporal redundancy (overall 45$\times$ compression rate), while enabling efficient training with large receptive field. We train the model from a language backbone through three progressive stages, each incorporating lengthy videos on average of 420s/1fps thanks to the perceiving efficiency. With only 0.8M total video-text samples for training, our model outperforms the direct baseline employing a fixed partitioning strategy by a maximum of 8.72 in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness in performance. On Video-MME, Quicksviewer achieves SOTA under modest sequence lengths using just up to 5\% of tokens per frame required by baselines. With this paradigm, scaling up the number of input frames reveals a clear power law of the model capabilities. It is also empirically verified that the segments generated by the cubing network can help for analyzing continuous events in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Video-Language Models to 10K Frames via Hierarchical Differential Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02438v3)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |

We propose a method to predict such ecological properties directly from remote sensing (RS) images by aligning them with species habitat descriptions. We introduce the EcoWikiRS dataset, consisting of high-resolution aerial images, the corresponding geolocated species observations, and, for each species, the textual descriptions of their habitat from Wikipedia. EcoWikiRS offers a scalable way of supervision for RS vision language models (RS-VLMs) for ecology. This is a setting with weak and noisy supervision, where, for instance, some text may describe properties that are specific only to part of the species' niche or is irrelevant to a specific image. We tackle this by proposing WINCEL, a weighted version of the InfoNCE loss. We evaluate our model on the task of ecosystem zero-shot classification by following the habitat definitions from the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). Our results show that our approach helps in understanding RS images in a more ecologically meaningful manner.

However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort. This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM, an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.</p></details> | VCM |

Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate.

| **[LR-IAD:Mask-Free Industrial Anomaly Detection with Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19524v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality by identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations, leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally, industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance, with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms, enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks. This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality control in manufacturing.

| **[On the Trustworthiness of Generative Foundation Models: Guideline, Assessment, and Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14296v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Foundation Models (GenFMs) have emerged as transformative tools. However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Training on specialty-specific literature could yield high-performance, task-specific tools, enabling generative AI to match generalist models in specialty publishing, educational, and clinical tasks. We created NeuroPubs, a multimodal dataset of 23,000 Neurosurgery Publications articles (134M words, 78K image-caption pairs). Using NeuroPubs, VLMs generated publication-ready graphical abstracts (70% of 100 abstracts) and board-style questions indistinguishable from human-written ones (54% of 89,587 questions). We used these questions to train CNS-Obsidian, a 34B-parameter VLM. In a blinded, randomized controlled trial, our model demonstrated non-inferiority to then state-of-the-art GPT-4o in neurosurgical differential diagnosis (clinical utility, 40.62% upvotes vs. 57.89%, p=0.1150; accuracy, 59.38% vs. 65.79%, p=0.3797). Our pilot study demonstrates how training generative AI models on specialty-specific journal content - without large-scale internet data - results in high-performance academic and clinical tools, enabling domain-tailored AI across diverse fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

| **[Boosting Single-domain Generalized Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19086v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train an object detector on a single source domain while generalizing well to diverse unseen target domains, making it suitable for multimedia applications that involve various domain shifts, such as intelligent video surveillance and VR/AR technologies. With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with 34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath.

| **[Towards Interpreting Visual Information Processing in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07149v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful tools for processing and understanding text and images. We study the processing of visual tokens in the language model component of LLaVA, a prominent VLM. Our approach focuses on analyzing the localization of object information, the evolution of visual token representations across layers, and the mechanism of integrating visual information for predictions. Through ablation studies, we demonstrated that object identification accuracy drops by over 70\% when object-specific tokens are removed. We observed that visual token representations become increasingly interpretable in the vocabulary space across layers, suggesting an alignment with textual tokens corresponding to image content. Finally, we found that the model extracts object information from these refined representations at the last token position for prediction, mirroring the process in text-only language models for factual association tasks. These findings provide crucial insights into how VLMs process and integrate visual information, bridging the gap between our understanding of language and vision models, and paving the way for more interpretable and controllable multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video CLIP Model for Multi-View Echocardiography Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18800v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography involves recording videos of the heart using ultrasound, enabling clinicians to evaluate its condition. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered attention for automating the interpretation of echocardiographic videos. However, most existing VLMs proposed for medical interpretation thus far rely on single-frame (i.e., image) inputs. Consequently, these image-based models often exhibit lower diagnostic accuracy for conditions identifiable through cardiac motion. Moreover, echocardiographic videos are recorded from various views that depend on the direction of ultrasound emission, and certain views are more suitable than others for interpreting specific conditions. Incorporating multiple views could potentially yield further improvements in accuracy. In this study, we developed a video-language model that takes five different views and full video sequences as input, training it on pairs of echocardiographic videos and clinical reports from 60,747 cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this expanded approach achieves higher interpretation accuracy than models trained with only single-view videos or with still images.</p></details> |  |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v4)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

By examining over 100 research papers, we provide the first systematic analysis dedicated to 3D object detection with vision-language models. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of 3D object detection with vision-language models, emphasizing differences from 2D detection in spatial reasoning and data complexity. Traditional approaches using point clouds and voxel grids are compared to modern vision-language frameworks like CLIP and 3D LLMs, which enable open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with vision-language models. Visualization examples and evaluation benchmarks are discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current challenges, such as limited 3D-language datasets and computational demands, and propose future research directions to advance 3D object detection with vision-language models. >Object Detection, Vision-Language Models, Agents, VLMs, LLMs, AI</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Capability for Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18538v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile skills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on finite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. In this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability of imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data distribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper bounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate representations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters and the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance for designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly in determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders (e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to achieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high conditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood landscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In addition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from sharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima under fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning often exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only scaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of output labels conditioned on the same input.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCFormer: Efficient 3D Vision-Language Modeling with Decomposed Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05091v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely applied to 2D medical image analysis due to their ability to align visual and textual representations. However, extending VLMs to 3D imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs often rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, or on 3D convolutions, which require large numbers of parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along the depth, height, and width dimensions. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is trained and evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports. In zero-shot and fine-tuned detection of 18 pathologies, as well as in image-text retrieval tasks, DCFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D vision encoders, including CT-ViT, ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/DCFormer.</p></details> |  |

Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, and 12 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces BoxMed-RL, a groundbreaking unified training framework for generating spatially verifiable and explainable radiology reports. Built on a large vision-language model, BoxMed-RL revolutionizes report generation through two integrated phases: (1) In the Pretraining Phase, we refine the model via medical concept learning, using Chain-of-Thought supervision to internalize the radiologist-like workflow, followed by spatially verifiable reinforcement, which applies reinforcement learning to align medical findings with bounding boxes. (2) In the Downstream Adapter Phase, we freeze the pretrained weights and train a downstream adapter to ensure fluent and clinically credible reports. This framework precisely mimics radiologists' workflow, compelling the model to connect high-level medical concepts with definitive anatomical evidence. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that BoxMed-RL achieves an average 7% improvement in both METEOR and ROUGE-L metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. An average 5% improvement in large language model-based metrics further underscores BoxMed-RL's robustness in generating high-quality radiology reports.</p></details> |  |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Designing such feedback at scale, for all objects within a VR scene and their respective arrangements, remains a time-consuming task. We present Scene2Hap, an LLM-centered system that automatically designs object-level vibrotactile feedback for entire VR scenes based on the objects' semantic attributes and physical context. Scene2Hap employs a multimodal large language model to estimate the semantics and physical context of each object, including its material properties and vibration behavior, from the multimodal information present in the VR scene. This semantic and physical context is then used to create plausible vibrotactile signals by generating or retrieving audio signals and converting them to vibrotactile signals. For the more realistic spatial rendering of haptics in VR, Scene2Hap estimates the propagation and attenuation of vibration signals from their source across objects in the scene, considering the estimated material properties and physical context, such as the distance and contact between virtual objects. Results from two user studies confirm that Scene2Hap successfully estimates the semantics and physical context of VR scenes, and the physical modeling of vibration propagation improves usability, perceived materiality, and spatial awareness.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL), and DEEMO-MER, an instruction dataset for Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap in de-identity emotion reasoning. Our work contributes to ethical AI by advancing privacy-preserving emotion understanding and promoting responsible affective computing.</p></details> |  |

A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ma-xu.github.io/token-shuffle/ Add related works</p></details> |

Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support disinformation. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM question-answering accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of a random baseline. To address this, we introduce the first inference-time methods to improve performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective method extracts the underlying data table and uses a text-only LLM to answer the question based on the table. Our findings expose a critical blind spot in current research and establish benchmark results to guide future efforts in reliable MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this work, we propose Video-XL-Pro, an efficient method for extremely long video understanding, built upon Reconstructive Compression of Tokens (ReCoT), a learnable module that leverages self-supervised learning to generate comprehensive and compact video tokens. ReCoT introduces two key components: (i) Dynamic Token Synthesizer (DTS): DTS generates pseudo-video tokens from static image tokens by learning intra-token relationships, which are then used in masked video modeling. (ii) Semantic-Guided Masking (SGM): SGM adaptively masks redundant visual tokens to facilitate more effective reconstructive learning. To improve training efficiency in MLLMs fine-tuning, we introduce a video-specific dataset pruning strategy and design a simple yet Query-aware Selector that enables the model to precisely locate query-relevant video tokens. With only 3B parameters, Video-XL-Pro outperforms most 7B models trained on larger datasets across multiple long video understanding benchmarks. Moreover, it can process over 8K frames on a single A100 GPU while maintaining high-quality performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these general-domain MLLMs perform poorly in face perception tasks, often producing inaccurate or misleading responses to face-specific queries. To address this gap, we propose FaceInsight, the versatile face perception MLLM that provides fine-grained facial information. Our approach introduces visual-textual alignment of facial knowledge to model both uncertain dependencies and deterministic relationships among facial information, mitigating the limitations of language-driven reasoning. Additionally, we incorporate face segmentation maps as an auxiliary perceptual modality, enriching the visual input with localized structural cues to enhance semantic understanding. Comprehensive experiments and analyses across three face perception tasks demonstrate that FaceInsight consistently outperforms nine compared MLLMs under both training-free and fine-tuned settings.</p></details> |  |

To effectively assess the quality of the generated 3D data, there is a need for a reliable 3D evaluation tool. Unfortunately, existing 3D evaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or merely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse assessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable evaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets based on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is that many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric consistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among various foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models and tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across different aspects. Compared to prior work, Eval3D provides pixel-wise measurement, enables accurate 3D spatial feedback, and aligns more closely with human judgments. We comprehensively evaluate existing 3D generation models using Eval3D and highlight the limitations and challenges of current models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Converting website layout design into functional UI code is a time-consuming yet indispensable step of website development. Manual methods of converting visual designs into functional code present significant challenges, especially for non-experts. To explore automatic design-to-code solutions, we first conduct a motivating study on GPT-4o and identify three types of issues in generating UI code: element omission, element distortion, and element misarrangement. We further reveal that a focus on smaller visual segments can help multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mitigate these failures in the generation process. In this paper, we propose DCGen, a divide-and-conquer-based approach to automate the translation of webpage design to UI code. DCGen starts by dividing screenshots into manageable segments, generating code for each segment, and then reassembling them into complete UI code for the entire screenshot. We conduct extensive testing with a dataset comprised of real-world websites and various MLLMs and demonstrate that DCGen achieves up to a 15% improvement in visual similarity and 8% in code similarity for large input images. Human evaluations show that DCGen can help developers implement webpages significantly faster and more similar to the UI designs. To the best of our knowledge, DCGen is the first segment-aware MLLM-based approach for generating UI code directly from screenshots.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |
| **[Unsupervised Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18397v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and problem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the strong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available in https://github.com/kesenzhao/UV-CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing CUAs remain conceptual prototypes, hindered by shallow OS integration, fragile screenshot-based interaction, and disruptive execution. We present UFO2, a multiagent AgentOS for Windows desktops that elevates CUAs into practical, system-level automation. UFO2 features a centralized HostAgent for task decomposition and coordination, alongside a collection of application-specialized AppAgent equipped with native APIs, domain-specific knowledge, and a unified GUI--API action layer. This architecture enables robust task execution while preserving modularity and extensibility. A hybrid control detection pipeline fuses Windows UI Automation (UIA) with vision-based parsing to support diverse interface styles. Runtime efficiency is further enhanced through speculative multi-action planning, reducing per-step LLM overhead. Finally, a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) interface enables automation within an isolated virtual desktop, allowing agents and users to operate concurrently without interference. We evaluate UFO2 across over 20 real-world Windows applications, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and execution accuracy over prior CUAs. Our results show that deep OS integration unlocks a scalable path toward reliable, user-aligned desktop automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code of UFO2 is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/UFO/, with comprehensive documentation provided at https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/</p></details> |

In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V.

As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, Project page: https://garygutc.github.io/UniME</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Pyramid Network for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20322v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at https://github.com/aihao2000/DPN-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |
| **[QUART-Online: Latency-Free Large Multimodal Language Model for Quadruped Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15576v4)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.
