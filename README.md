| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo Anomalies Are All You Need: Diffusion-Based Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06845v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying video anomaly detection in practice is hampered by the scarcity and collection cost of real abnormal footage. We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CADE: Continual Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06840v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has long been studied as a crucial problem in public security and crime prevention. In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the "incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v4)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Semantics-Aware Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods face two critical challenges: (1) Strong generalization blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal patterns. Although existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue using memory modules, their rigid prototype-matching process limits adaptability to diverse scenarios; (2) Relying solely on low-level appearance and motion cues makes it difficult to perceive high-level semantic anomalies in complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose SIB-VAD, a novel framework based on adaptive information bottleneck filtering and semantic-aware enhancement. We propose the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) to replace traditional memory modules. It compresses normal features directly into a low-dimensional manifold based on the information bottleneck principle and uses an adaptive routing mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable normal bottleneck subspace. Trained only on normal data, SFFMs only learn normal low-dimensional manifolds, while abnormal features deviate and are effectively filtered. Unlike memory modules, SFFM directly removes abnormal information and adaptively handles scene variations. To improve semantic awareness, we further design a multimodal prediction framework that jointly models appearance, motion, and semantics. Through multimodal consistency constraints and joint error computation, it achieves more robust VAD performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our feature filtering paradigm based on semantics-aware information bottleneck.

| **[Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Sparse Reasoning is Enough: Biological-Inspired Framework for Video Anomaly Detection with Large Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17094v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefineVAD: Semantic-Guided Feature Recalibration for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13204v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Learning Time in Static Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12321v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

| **[Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |
| **[M2S2L: Mamba-based Multi-Scale Spatial-temporal Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05564v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.</p></details> | IEEE VCIP 2025 |
| **[A Unified Reasoning Framework for Holistic Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00962v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training. Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding, yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection, localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in a fully zero-shot manner.

| **[TRACES: Temporal Recall with Contextual Embeddings for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00580v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context, which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve 90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection under Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask may be considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly scores. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detector), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions under weak supervision with two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate LaGoVAD's SOTA performance. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/Kamino666/LaGoVAD-PreVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Textual Reasoning for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07429v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |

| **[LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMUSE: Audio-Visual Benchmark and Alignment Framework for Agentic Multi-Speaker Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16250v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Training-free Adaptive Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on various vision-language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames, which quickly exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics in long-form videos, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work, we systematically examine the role of temporal information and show that extending selection from isolated key frames to temporally coherent key clips improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we introduce frame resolution as a controllable factor in frame selection, enabling a trade-off between spatial resolution and clip length. Building on this idea, we propose an adaptive clip length module that dynamically balances these factors to ensure a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling by up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling VLMs to real-world video understanding applications.

Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Action Form Assessment by Exploiting Multimodal Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15153v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies. Our dataset and source code is available at https://github.com/MICLAB-BUPT/EFA.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://timelens-arc-lab.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Zoom-Zero/</p></details> |
| **[From My View to Yours: Ego-to-Exo Transfer in VLMs for Understanding Activities of Daily Living](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05711v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance across diverse video understanding tasks. However, their viewpoint invariant training limits their ability to understand egocentric properties (e.g., human object interactions) from exocentric video observations. This limitation is critical for many applications, such as Activities of Daily Living (ADL) monitoring, where the understanding of egocentric properties is essential, and egocentric cameras are impractical to deploy. To address this limitation, we propose Ego2ExoVLM, a VLM that learns to infer egocentric properties from exocentric videos by leveraging time-synchronized ego-exo videos during training. Ego2ExoVLM accomplishes this through the use of two components: Ego2Exo Sequence Distillation, which transfers knowledge from an egocentric teacher to an exocentric student, and Ego Adaptive Visual Tokens, designed to enhance the effectiveness of this knowledge transfer. To measure this capability, we introduce Ego-in-Exo Perception, a benchmark of 3.9K questions curated to explicitly measure the understanding of egocentric properties from exocentric videos. Ego2ExoVLM is evaluated on 10 tasks across Ego-in-Exo Perception and existing ADL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ADL-X benchmark suite and outperforming strong baselines on our proposed benchmark. All code, models, and data will be released at https://github.com/dominickrei/EgoExo4ADL.</p></details> |  |

To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[KFS-Bench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Key Frame Sampling in Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14017v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.</p></details> | WACV2026 |

To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

Existing pruning techniques fail to effectively exploit the spatiotemporal redundancy present in video data. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic analysis of video redundancy from two perspectives: temporal context and visual context. Leveraging these insights, we propose Dynamic Density Pruning for Fast Video LLMs termed FastVID. Specifically, FastVID dynamically partitions videos into temporally ordered segments to preserve temporal structure and applies a density-based token pruning strategy to maintain essential spatial and temporal information. Our method significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining temporal and visual integrity. Extensive evaluations show that FastVID achieves state-of-the-art performance across various short- and long-video benchmarks on leading Video LLMs, including LLaVA-OneVision, LLaVA-Video, Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-VL. Notably, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, FastVID effectively prunes $\textbf{90.3%}$ of video tokens, reduces FLOPs to $\textbf{8.3%}$, and accelerates the LLM prefill stage by $\textbf{7.1}\times$, while maintaining $\textbf{98.0%}$ of the original accuracy.

However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.</p></details> |  |

Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce UFVideo, the first Video LLM with unified multi-grained cooperative understanding capabilities. Specifically, we design unified visual-language guided alignment to flexibly handle video understanding across global, pixel and temporal scales within a single model. UFVideo dynamically encodes the visual and text inputs of different tasks and generates the textual response, temporal localization, or grounded mask. Additionally, to evaluate challenging multi-grained video understanding tasks, we construct the UFVideo-Bench consisting of three distinct collaborative tasks within the scales, which demonstrates UFVideo's flexibility and advantages over GPT-4o. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our model across 9 public benchmarks covering various common video understanding tasks, providing valuable insights for future Video LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, technical report</p></details> |

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Understanding videos in challenging conditions like occlusion, camouflage, or rapid movement often depends more on motion dynamics than static appearance. TCAM autonomously observes a video, identifies multiple motion activities, and spatially grounds each natural language description to its corresponding trajectory through a motion-field attention mechanism. Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention. On the MeViS benchmark, TCAM achieves 58.4% video-to-text retrieval, 64.9 JF for spatial grounding, and discovers 4.8 relevant expressions per video with 84.7% precision, demonstrating strong cross-task generalization.</p></details> |  |

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures.

However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://n3d-vlm.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Laws for Energy Efficiency of Local LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16531v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[TTP: Test-Time Padding for Adversarial Detection and Robust Adaptation on Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16523v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

While humans naturally localize themselves using such maps, translating this capability to robotic systems remains highly challenging due to the difficulty of establishing correspondences between observed landmarks and those in the map without geometric and appearance details. To address this challenge, VLG-Loc leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to search the robot's multi-directional image observations for the landmarks noted in the map. The method then identifies robot poses within a Monte Carlo localization framework, where the found landmarks are used to evaluate the likelihood of each pose hypothesis. Experimental validation in simulated and real-world retail environments demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing scan-based methods, particularly under environmental changes. Further improvements are achieved through the probabilistic fusion of visual and scan-based localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: U...</summary><p>v2: Updated the citation of SparseLoc from an arXiv preprint to its published version in the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Edge-to-Server Inference for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16349v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[MoAPT: Mixture of Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17509v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities but remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples, posing potential security risks. To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters. However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image features, which ultimately results in overfitting. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number of learned prompts yields greater robustness improvements than simply extending the length of a single prompt. Building on this observation, we propose an adversarial tuning method named \textbf{Mixture of Adversarial Prompt Tuning (MoAPT)} to enhance the generalization against various adversarial attacks for VLMs. MoAPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight router based on the adversarial images to predict the mixture weights of multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific mixture text features aligning with different adversarial image features. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets under different settings show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

This study focuses on generating precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable for VI users. Specifically, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to navigation instructions, thereby providing feedback rewards to guide the post-training of a Vision-Language Model (VLM). This enhances instruction accuracy and usability while reducing costly real-world data collection needs. To address the scarcity of dedicated benchmarks in this field, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-source dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. It comprises diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed and open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI demonstrate the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO through quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU 14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o 0.323), and qualitative analysis further confirms that our method yields more intuitive and safer instructions.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI-26 |
| **[Scaling Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs through Programmatic Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16237v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for Grounded Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16201v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.</p></details> |  |

Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRG-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Clinically Aligned Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16145v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured "thinking report" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.</p></details> | technical report |

We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.</p></details> | Draft version |

However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8977 (95% CI: 0.88-0.91). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sketch-in-Latents: Eliciting Unified Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16584v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/yanxuzhu/MoHoBench.</p></details> | AAAI2026 Oral |
| **[AMUSE: Audio-Visual Benchmark and Alignment Framework for Agentic Multi-Speaker Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16250v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Perceptual Observatory Characterizing Robustness and Grounding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15949v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[City Navigation in the Wild: Exploring Emergent Navigation from Web-Scale Knowledge in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15933v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

| **[Seeing Beyond Words: Self-Supervised Visual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15885v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/JARVIS.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JoeLeelyf/Skyra</p></details> |
| **[Large Video Planner Enables Generalizable Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15840v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

| **[GRAN-TED: Generating Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embedding for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15560v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Our code is available at the following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRAN-TED-4FCC/.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15528v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.</p></details> |  |

HVSBench: A Benchmark for MLLM Alignment with Human Perceptual Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at many vision tasks, it is unknown if they exhibit human-like perceptual behaviors. To evaluate this, we introduce HVSBench, the first large-scale benchmark with over 85,000 samples designed to test MLLM alignment with the human visual system (HVS). The benchmark covers 13 categories across 5 key fields: Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a significant perceptual gap: even state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve only moderate results. In contrast, human participants demonstrate strong performance, significantly outperforming all models. This underscores the high quality of HVSBench and the need for more human-aligned AI. We believe our benchmark will be a critical tool for developing the next generation of explainable MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiaying.link/HVSBench/</p></details> |

However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for ACL 2026</p></details> |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://timelens-arc-lab.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
