| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> |  |

| **[QuoTA: Query-oriented Token Assignment via CoT Query Decouple for Long Video Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08689v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual redundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution. However, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in decoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between visual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an ante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language models (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level importance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it aligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token budget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content. Specifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores based on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before cross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame importance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that extends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that implementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance improvement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while operating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To effectively assess their video comprehension capabilities, long video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and MLVU, are proposed. However, these benchmarks directly use uniform frame sampling for testing, which results in significant information loss and affects the accuracy of the evaluations in reflecting the true abilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose RAG-Adapter, a plug-and-play framework that reduces information loss during testing by sampling frames most relevant to the given question. Additionally, we introduce a Grouped-supervised Contrastive Learning (GCL) method to further enhance sampling effectiveness of RAG-Adapter through fine-tuning on our constructed MMAT dataset. Finally, we test numerous baseline MLLMs on various video understanding benchmarks, finding that RAG-Adapter sampling consistently outperforms uniform sampling (e.g., Accuracy of GPT-4o increases by 9.3 percent on Video-MME), providing a more accurate testing method for long video benchmarks.</p></details> | 37 pages, 36 figures |

However, this becomes even more challenging when dealing with long-form videos, lasting from minutes to hours, in educational and news domains due to the need for more annotators with subject expertise. Hence, there arises a need for automated solutions. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to capture concise and informative content that allows the comprehension of entire videos by leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. ASR provides textual content from audio, while OCR extracts textual content from specific frames. This paper introduces a dataset comprising long-form lectures and news videos. We present baseline approaches to understand their limitations on this dataset and advocate for exploring prompt engineering techniques to comprehend long-form multimodal video datasets comprehensively.</p></details> | CVIP 2024 |

While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing search inefficiencies and domain knowledge gaps as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 24.3% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Sparrow: Data-Efficient Video-LLM with Text-to-Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19951v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

However, most existing video understanding benchmarks are relatively short, which makes them inadequate for effectively evaluating the long-sequence modeling capabilities of MLLMs. This highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive and integrated long video understanding benchmark to assess the ability of MLLMs thoroughly. To this end, we propose ALLVB (ALL-in-One Long Video Understanding Benchmark). ALLVB's main contributions include: 1) It integrates 9 major video understanding tasks. These tasks are converted into video QA formats, allowing a single benchmark to evaluate 9 different video understanding capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting the versatility, comprehensiveness, and challenging nature of ALLVB. 2) A fully automated annotation pipeline using GPT-4o is designed, requiring only human quality control, which facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the benchmark. 3) It contains 1,376 videos across 16 categories, averaging nearly 2 hours each, with a total of 252k QAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest long video understanding benchmark in terms of the number of videos, average duration, and number of QAs. We have tested various mainstream MLLMs on ALLVB, and the results indicate that even the most advanced commercial models have significant room for improvement. This reflects the benchmark's challenging nature and demonstrates the substantial potential for development in long video understanding.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

These methods retrieve useful moments from long videos for their presented tasks, thereby enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate high-quality answers in a cost-effective way. In this work, we present MomentSeeker, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate retrieval models' performance in handling general long-video moment retrieval (LVMR) tasks. MomentSeeker offers three key advantages. First, it incorporates long videos of over 500 seconds on average, making it the first benchmark specialized for long-video moment retrieval. Second, it covers a wide range of task categories (including Moment Search, Caption Alignment, Image-conditioned Moment Search, and Video-conditioned Moment Search) and diverse application scenarios (e.g., sports, movies, cartoons, and ego), making it a comprehensive tool for assessing retrieval models' general LVMR performance. Additionally, the evaluation tasks are carefully curated through human annotation, ensuring the reliability of assessment. We further fine-tune an MLLM-based LVMR retriever on synthetic data, which demonstrates strong performance on our benchmark. We perform extensive experiments with various popular multimodal retrievers based on our benchmark, whose results highlight the challenges of LVMR and limitations for existing methods. Our created resources will be shared with community to advance future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, this paper introduces a Video Understanding and Reasoning Framework (VURF) based on the reasoning power of LLMs. Ours is a novel approach to extend the utility of LLMs in the context of video tasks, leveraging their capacity to generalize from minimal input and output demonstrations within a contextual framework. We harness their contextual learning capabilities by presenting LLMs with pairs of instructions and their corresponding high-level programs to generate executable visual programs for video understanding. To enhance the program's accuracy and robustness, we implement two important strategies. \emph{Firstly,} we employ a feedback-generation approach, powered by GPT-3.5, to rectify errors in programs utilizing unsupported functions. \emph{Secondly}, taking motivation from recent works on self-refinement of LLM outputs, we introduce an iterative procedure for improving the quality of the in-context examples by aligning the initial outputs to the outputs that would have been generated had the LLM not been bound by the structure of the in-context examples. Our results on several video-specific tasks, including visual QA, video anticipation, pose estimation, and multi-video QA, illustrate these enhancements' efficacy in improving the performance of visual programming approaches for video tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent works address this task by sampling numerous frames or incorporating auxiliary tools using LLMs, both of which result in high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a curiosity-driven video agent with self-exploration capability, dubbed as VCA. Built upon VLMs, VCA autonomously navigates video segments and efficiently builds a comprehensive understanding of complex video sequences. Instead of directly sampling frames, VCA employs a tree-search structure to explore video segments and collect frames. Rather than relying on external feedback or reward, VCA leverages VLM's self-generated intrinsic reward to guide its exploration, enabling it to capture the most crucial information for reasoning. Experimental results on multiple long video benchmarks demonstrate our approach's superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets exhibit gaps in temporal and spatial granularity, which consequently limits the capabilities of existing VideoQA methods. This paper introduces the Multi-Object Multi-Actor Question Answering (MOMA-QA) dataset, which is designed to address these shortcomings by emphasizing temporal localization, spatial relationship reasoning, and entity-centric queries. With ground truth scene graphs and temporal interval annotations, MOMA-QA is ideal for developing models for fine-grained video understanding. Furthermore, we present a novel video-language model, SGVLM, which incorporates a scene graph predictor, an efficient frame retriever, and a pre-trained large language model for temporal localization and fine-grained relationship understanding. Evaluations on MOMA-QA and other public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, setting new benchmarks for VideoQA.</p></details> |  |

This task encompasses several subtasks, including temporal action localization, temporal video grounding, moment retrieval, and generic event boundary detection. Existing methods in each subfield are typically designed for specific tasks and lack generalizability across domains. In this paper, we propose TimeLoc, a unified end-to-end framework for timestamp localization that can handle multiple tasks. First, our approach employs a simple yet effective one-stage localization model that supports text queries as input and multiple actions as output. Second, we jointly train the video encoder and localization model in an end-to-end manner. To efficiently process long videos, we introduce temporal chunking, enabling the handling of videos with over 30k frames. Third, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained text encoders with a multi-stage training strategy further enhances text-conditioned localization. TimeLoc achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks: +1.3% and +1.9% mAP over previous best methods on THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens-100, +1.1% on Kinetics-GEBD, +2.94% mAP on QVHighlights, and significant improvements in temporal video grounding (+11.5% on TACoS and +6.7% on Charades-STA under R1@0.5).

Various benchmarks are introduced for better evaluating the MLLMs. Nevertheless, current video benchmarks are still inefficient for evaluating video models during iterative development due to the high cost of constructing datasets and the difficulty in isolating specific skills. In this paper, we propose VideoNIAH (Video Needle In A Haystack), a benchmark construction framework through synthetic video generation. VideoNIAH decouples video content from their query-responses by inserting unrelated visual 'needles' into original videos. The framework automates the generation of query-response pairs using predefined rules, minimizing manual labor. The queries focus on specific aspects of video understanding, enabling more skill-specific evaluations. The separation between video content and the queries also allow for increased video variety and evaluations across different lengths. Utilizing VideoNIAH, we compile a video benchmark VNBench, which includes tasks such as retrieval, ordering, and counting to evaluate three key aspects of video understanding: temporal perception, chronological ordering, and spatio-temporal coherence. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both proprietary and open-source models, uncovering significant differences in their video understanding capabilities across various tasks. Additionally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the test results and model configurations. Based on these findings, we provide some advice for improving video MLLM training, offering valuable insights to guide future research and model development.

A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |
| **[Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04130v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (\textbf{S}patiotemporal \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{R}eduction for \textbf{M}ultimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Some previous research indicates that taking texts in videos as input can further improve the performance of video understanding. As a type of indispensable information in short videos or movies, subtitles can assist LVLMs to better understand videos. Most existing methods for video subtitle extraction are based on a multi-stage framework, handling each frame independently. They can hardly exploit the temporal information of videos. Although some LVLMs exhibit the robust OCR capability, predicting accurate timestamps for subtitle texts is still challenging. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end Video Subtitle Extraction method, called EVE, which consists of three modules: a vision encoder, an adapter module, and a large language model. To effectively compress the visual tokens from the vision encoder, we propose a novel adapter InterleavedVT to interleave two modalities. It contains a visual compressor and a textual region compressor. The proposed InterleavedVT exploits both the merits of average pooling and Q-Former in token compression. Taking the temporal information of videos into account, we introduce a sliding-window mechanism in the textual region compressor. To benchmark the video subtitle extraction task, we propose a large dataset ViSa including 2.5M videos. Extensive experiments on ViSa demonstrate that the proposed EVE can outperform existing open-sourced tools and LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

However, language-conditioned robotic manipulation for contact-rich tasks remains underexplored, particularly in terms of tactile sensing. To address this gap, we introduce the Tactile-Language-Action (TLA) model, which effectively processes sequential tactile feedback via cross-modal language grounding to enable robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios. In addition, we construct a comprehensive dataset that contains 24k pairs of tactile action instruction data, customized for fingertip peg-in-hole assembly, providing essential resources for TLA training and evaluation. Our results show that TLA significantly outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policy) in terms of effective action generation and action accuracy, while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities by achieving over 85\% success rate on previously unseen assembly clearances and peg shapes. We publicly release all data and code in the hope of advancing research in language-conditioned tactile manipulation skill learning.

| **[GTR: Guided Thought Reinforcement Prevents Thought Collapse in RL-based VLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08525v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p></details> |  |

With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization.

Our novel superpixel approach ensures that the model receives object-like features whilst the use of VLMs provides our model with open set object understanding. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to make use of multi-resolution inputs, allowing our model to view images in different levels of detail, and use an attention mechanism to determine which parts are most relevant to the caption. We demonstrate our model's performance with multiple VLMs and through a range of ablations detailing the impact of different architectural choices. Our full model achieves a competitive CIDEr score of $136.9$ on the COCO Karpathy split.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PhysVLM: Enabling Visual Language Models to Understand Robotic Physical Reachability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08481v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the environment and a robot's physical reachability is crucial for task execution. While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silent Hazards of Token Reduction in Vision-Language Models: The Hidden Impact on Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06794v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have excelled in visual reasoning but often incur high computational costs. One key reason is the redundancy of visual tokens. Although recent token reduction methods claim to achieve minimal performance loss, our extensive experiments reveal that token reduction can substantially alter a model's output distribution, leading to changes in prediction patterns that standard metrics such as accuracy loss do not fully capture. Such inconsistencies are especially concerning for practical applications where system stability is critical. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze how token reduction influences the energy distribution of a VLM's internal representations using a lower-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our results show that changes in the Inverse Participation Ratio of the singular value spectrum are strongly correlated with the model's consistency after token reduction. Based on these insights, we propose LoFi--a training-free visual token reduction method that utilizes the leverage score from SVD for token pruning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LoFi not only reduces computational costs with minimal performance degradation but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of output consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are foundation models for computer vision good conformal predictors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06082v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervision and contrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedRand: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with Randomized LoRA Subparameter Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07216v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, recent studies indicate that tuned VLMs may suffer from the problem of spurious correlations, where the model relies on spurious features (e.g. background and gender) in the data. This may lead to the model having worse robustness in out-of-distribution data. Standard methods for eliminating spurious correlation typically require us to know the spurious attribute labels of each sample, which is hard in the real world. In this work, we explore improving the group robustness of prompt tuning in VLMs without relying on manual annotation of spurious features. We notice the zero - shot image recognition ability of VLMs and use this ability to identify spurious features, thus avoiding the cost of manual annotation. By leveraging pseudo-spurious attribute annotations, we further propose a method to automatically adjust the training weights of different groups. Extensive experiments show that our approach efficiently improves the worst-group accuracy on CelebA, Waterbirds, and MetaShift datasets, achieving the best robustness gap between the worst-group accuracy and the overall accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference process remains uninterpretable, leading to criticisms of these models as "black box" systems. To address this issue, we propose a domain knowledge-enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt generation mechanism, which is used to semi-automatically construct a task-specific instruction-following dataset, TITANIC-FGS. By training on TITANIC-FGS, we adapt general-domain vision-language models (VLMs) to the FGSC task, resulting in a model named IFShip. Building upon IFShip, we develop an FGSC visual chatbot that redefines the FGSC problem as a step-by-step reasoning task and conveys the reasoning process in natural language. Experimental results show that IFShip outperforms state-of-the-art FGSC algorithms in both interpretability and classification accuracy. Furthermore, compared to VLMs such as LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, IFShip demonstrates superior performance on the FGSC task. It provides an accurate chain of reasoning when fine-grained ship types are recognizable to the human eye and offers interpretable explanations when they are not.</p></details> |  |
| **[Talk2PC: Enhancing 3D Visual Grounding through LiDAR and Radar Point Clouds Fusion for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08336v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied outdoor scene understanding forms the foundation for autonomous agents to perceive, analyze, and react to dynamic driving environments. However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Modeling Variants of Prompts for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08229v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to leveraging human language for enhancing downstream tasks. However, VLMs such as CLIP face significant limitation: its performance is highly sensitive to prompt template design. Although prompt learning methods can address the sensitivity issue by replacing natural language prompts with learnable ones, they are incomprehensible to humans. Ensuring consistent performance across various prompt templates enables models to adapt seamlessly to diverse phrasings, enhancing their ability to handle downstream tasks without requiring extensive prompt engineering. In this work, we introduce the RobustPrompt Benchmark, a systematic benchmark to evaluate robustness to different prompt templates for VLMs. It includes a dataset with hundreds of carefully designed prompt templates, divided into six types, covering a wide variety of commonly used templates. Beside the benchmark, we propose Modeling Variants of Prompts (MVP), a simple yet effective method that mitigates sensitivity by modeling variants of prompt structures. The innovation of MVP lies in decoupling prompts into templates and class names, and using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to model the distribution of diverse prompt structures. Experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that MVP can greatly enhance model robustness to variations in input prompts without a drop in performance. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaoyaoxinyi/MVP.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations to insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that hallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during decoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs' visual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less discriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating broader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to hallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive instruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a novel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and Disentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling LVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID consists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies Attention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next, Attention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of these identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on subsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between instruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces hallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational inefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario resolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled with reward-instruct training strategy. In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$ lower collision rate.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, their performance in 3D spatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains limited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images as inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely vision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on visual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates the limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary shortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene and individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual prompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the global-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding of indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV) image from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the BEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames with markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over closed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video dataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks. Surprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently improve during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as explicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs develop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a seamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gpt4scene.github.io/</p></details> |

However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration across diverse degradation scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical remote sensing applications.

While foundation models demonstrate remarkable performance on some benchmarks, they still struggle with 3D reasoning tasks like arranging objects in space according to open-ended language instructions, particularly in dense and physically constrained environments. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve their reasoning performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/layoutvlm/</p></details> |

While token compression techniques can reduce computational costs, existing approaches are designed for single-view LVLMs and fail to consider the unique multi-view characteristics of recent high-resolution LVLMs with dynamic tiling. While existing methods treat all tokens uniformly, our analysis reveals that global thumbnails can naturally guide the compression of local crops by providing holistic context for informativeness evaluation. In this paper, we first analyze dynamic tiling strategy comprehensively, revealing both the complementary nature between thumbnails and crops, and the distinctive characteristics across different crops. Based on our observations, we propose "Global Compression Commander" (i.e., GlobalCom$^2$), a novel plug-and-play token compression framework for HR-LVLMs. GlobalCom$^2$ leverages thumbnail as the "commander" to guide the compression process of local crops, adaptively preserving informative details while eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments show that GlobalCom$^2$ maintains over 90\% performance while compressing 90\% visual tokens, reducing FLOPs and peak memory to 9.1\% and 60\% respectively across multiple benchmarks.

As a result, these models often depend on frame sampling, which risks missing key information over time and lacks task-specific relevance. To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After a three-stage training approach, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception and understanding performance, and the combination of these two capabilities also unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating their complementary roles in MLLM.

Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

Hybrid Retrieval, which integrates Sparse Retrieval (e.g., BM25) and Dense Retrieval (e.g., vector embeddings), has become a widely adopted approach for improving search effectiveness. However, its performance heavily depends on the quality of input text, which is often degraded when dealing with non-narrative documents such as PDFs containing financial statements, contractual clauses, and tables. KAP addresses these challenges by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with LLM-driven post-OCR processing, refining extracted text to reduce OCR noise, restore table structures, and optimize text format. By ensuring better compatibility with Hybrid Retrieval, KAP improves the accuracy of both Sparse and Dense Retrieval methods without modifying the retrieval architecture itself.</p></details> |  |

Recent works adapt agentic frameworks or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. However, CoT-based multimodal reasoning often demands costly data annotation and fine-tuning, while agentic approaches relying on external tools risk introducing unreliable output from these tools. In this paper, we propose Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence (SRICE), a training-free multimodal reasoning framework that integrates external vision models with uncertainty quantification (UQ) into an MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, SRICE guides the inference process by allowing MLLM to autonomously select regions of interest through multi-stage interactions with the help of external tools. We propose to use a conformal prediction-based approach to calibrate the output of external tools and select the optimal tool by estimating the uncertainty of an MLLM's output. Our experiment shows that the average improvement of SRICE over the base MLLM is 4.6% on five datasets and the performance on some datasets even outperforms fine-tuning-based methods, revealing the significance of ensuring reliable tool use in an MLLM agent.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</p></details> |  |

EgoBlind comprises 1,210 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 4,927 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 15 leading MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy around 56\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and provide heuristic suggestions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Towards Large-scale Chemical Reaction Image Parsing via a Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08156v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant promise in advancing organic chemistry research; however, its effectiveness depends on the availability of high-quality chemical reaction data. Currently, most published chemical reactions are not available in machine-readable form, limiting the broader application of AI in this field. The extraction of published chemical reactions into structured databases still relies heavily on manual curation, and robust automatic parsing of chemical reaction images into machine-readable data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Reaction Image Multimodal large language model (RxnIM), the first multimodal large language model specifically designed to parse chemical reaction images into machine-readable reaction data. RxnIM not only extracts key chemical components from reaction images but also interprets the textual content that describes reaction conditions. Together with specially designed large-scale dataset generation method to support model training, our approach achieves excellent performance, with an average F1 score of 88% on various benchmarks, surpassing literature methods by 5%. This represents a crucial step toward the automatic construction of large databases of machine-readable reaction data parsed from images in the chemistry literature, providing essential data resources for AI research in chemistry. The source code, model checkpoints, and datasets developed in this work are released under permissive licenses. An instance of the RxnIM web application can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/CYF200127/RxnIM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimus-2: Multimodal Minecraft Agent with Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19902v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building an agent that can mimic human behavior patterns to accomplish various open-world tasks is a long-term goal. To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.

| **[Grounding-IQA: Multimodal Language Grounding Model for Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17237v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application.

However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for developing MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding.

| **[Think Before You Segment: High-Quality Reasoning Segmentation with GPT Chain of Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07503v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation is a challenging vision-language task that aims to output the segmentation mask with respect to a complex, implicit, and even non-visual query text. Previous works incorporated multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with segmentation models to approach the difficult problem. However, their segmentation quality often falls short in complex cases, particularly when dealing with out-of-domain objects with intricate structures, blurry boundaries, occlusions, or high similarity with surroundings. In this paper, we introduce ThinkFirst, a training-free reasoning segmentation framework that leverages GPT's chain of thought to address these challenging cases. Our approach allows GPT-4o or other powerful MLLMs to generate a detailed, chain-of-thought description of an image. This summarized description is then passed to a language-instructed segmentation assistant to aid the segmentation process. Our framework allows users to easily interact with the segmentation agent using multimodal inputs, such as easy text and image scribbles, for successive refinement or communication. We evaluate the performance of ThinkFirst on diverse objects. Extensive experiments show that, this zero-shot-CoT approach significantly improves the vanilla reasoning segmentation agent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while being less sensitive or critical to user-supplied prompts after Thinking First.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~skao/thinkfirst.html</p></details> |
| **[LLaVA-RadZ: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Effectively Tackle Zero-shot Radiology Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07487v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various vision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparrow: Data-Efficient Video-LLM with Text-to-Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19951v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data. The code and data examples are available at https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Sparrow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Sparrow</p></details> |
| **[REF-VLM: Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm for Unified Visual Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07413v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate robust zero-shot capabilities across diverse vision-language tasks after training on mega-scale datasets. However, dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and keypoint detection, pose significant challenges for MLLMs when represented solely as text outputs. Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent embeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability to both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we present REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual decoding tasks. To address complex visual decoding scenarios, we introduce the Triplet-Based Referring Paradigm (TRP), which explicitly decouples three critical dimensions in visual decoding tasks through a triplet structure: concepts, decoding types, and targets. TRP employs symbolic delimiters to enforce structured representation learning, enhancing the parsability and interpretability of model outputs. Additionally, we construct Visual-Task Instruction Following Dataset (VTInstruct), a large-scale multi-task dataset containing over 100 million multimodal dialogue samples across 25 task types. Beyond text inputs and outputs, VT-Instruct incorporates various visual prompts such as point, box, scribble, and mask, and generates outputs composed of text and visual units like box, keypoint, depth and mask. The combination of different visual prompts and visual units generates a wide variety of task types, expanding the applicability of REF-VLM significantly. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our REF-VLM outperforms other MLLMs across a variety of standard benchmarks.

| **[Calling a Spade a Heart: Gaslighting Multimodal Large Language Models via Negation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19017v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. Our findings provide critical insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against negation inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Ophthalmic Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models with Fundus Photographs and OCT Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07094v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across various medical applications. Building on this foundation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate LLMs with visual models to process diverse inputs, including clinical data and medical images. In ophthalmology, LLMs have been explored for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) reports, assisting in disease classification, and even predicting treatment outcomes. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fail to capture the complexities of real-world clinical practice, particularly in the analysis of OCT images. Many suffer from limitations such as small sample sizes, a lack of diverse OCT datasets, and insufficient expert validation. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of MLLMs' ability to interpret OCT scans and their broader applicability in ophthalmology. Our dataset, curated through rigorous quality control and expert annotation, consists of 439 fundus images and 75 OCT images. Using a standardized API-based framework, we assessed seven mainstream MLLMs and observed significant variability in diagnostic accuracy across different diseases. While some models performed well in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, they struggled with others, including choroidal neovascularization and myopia, highlighting inconsistencies in performance and the need for further refinement. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing clinically relevant benchmarks to provide a more accurate assessment of MLLMs' capabilities. By refining these models and expanding their scope, we can enhance their potential to transform ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taking Notes Brings Focus? Towards Multi-Turn Multimodal Dialogue Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07002v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), built on large-scale pre-trained vision towers and language models, have shown great capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
