| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Reasoning Framework for Holistic Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00962v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training. Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding, yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection, localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in a fully zero-shot manner.

| **[TRACES: Temporal Recall with Contextual Embeddings for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00580v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context, which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve 90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection under Weak Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask may be considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly scores. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detector), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions under weak supervision with two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate LaGoVAD's SOTA performance. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/Kamino666/LaGoVAD-PreVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/PANDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MTFL: Multi-Timescale Feature Learning for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05900v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of anomaly events is relevant for public safety and requires a combination of fine-grained motion information and contextual events at variable time-scales. To this end, we propose a Multi-Timescale Feature Learning (MTFL) method to enhance the representation of anomaly features. Short, medium, and long temporal tubelets are employed to extract spatio-temporal video features using a Video Swin Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that MTFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-Crime dataset, achieving an anomaly detection performance 89.78% AUC. Moreover, it performs complementary to SotA with 95.32% AUC on the ShanghaiTech and 84.57% AP on the XD-Violence dataset. Furthermore, we generate an extended dataset of the UCF-Crime for development and evaluation on a wider range of anomalies, namely Video Anomaly Detection Dataset (VADD), involving 2,591 videos in 18 classes with extensive coverage of realistic anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameShield: Adversarially Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21532v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.</p></details> | 28 page, 5 figures |
| **[MoniTor: Exploiting Large Language Models with Instruction for Online Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21449v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame. Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available at https://github.com/YsTvT/MoniTor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. The first two authors hold equal contributions</p></details> |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cerberus: Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection via Cascaded Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16290v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a 151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time video analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made prematurely.

| **[Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task. Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages in IEEE double-column format, 1 figure, 5 tables.

Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics.

However, existing video understanding benchmarks largely overlook textual information, while OCR-specific benchmarks are constrained to static images, limiting their ability to capture the interaction between text and dynamic visual contexts. To address this gap, we propose VidText, a new benchmark designed for comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of video text understanding. VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery (DVD) agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Unlike previous video agents that rely on predefined workflows applied uniformly across different queries, our approach emphasizes the autonomous and adaptive nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools to orchestrate adaptive workflow for different queries in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates our advantage. Our DVD agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging LVBench dataset, reaching an accuracy of 74.2%, which substantially surpasses all prior works, and further improves to 76.0% with transcripts.

| **[Aligning Effective Tokens with Video Anomaly in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06350v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fleming-VL: Towards Universal Medical Visual Reasoning with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00916v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities. Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented 2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at https://github.com/TechNomad-ds/LoVR-benchmark</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoExplorer: Think With Videos For Agentic Long-Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v6)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).</p></details> |  |

By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |

However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences. To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens, drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free, model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its efficiency in processing speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[VRoPE: Rotary Position Embedding for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11664v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has shown strong performance in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), but extending it to video remains a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal structure of video frames. Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks.

Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments. We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava.

Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%.

However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference.

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.</p></details> |  |

This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding.

Real visual understanding, especially of physics and common sense, is essential for AI systems that interact with the physical world. Current evaluations mostly use real-world videos similar to training data, so high benchmark scores may not reflect real reasoning ability. To address this, we propose negative-control tests using videos that depict physically impossible or logically inconsistent events. We introduce VideoHallu, a synthetic dataset of physics- and commonsense-violating scenes generated with Veo2, Sora, and Kling. It includes expert-annotated question-answer pairs across four categories of violations. Tests of leading VLMs (Qwen-2.5-VL, Video-R1, VideoChat-R1) show that, despite strong results on benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU, they often miss these violations, exposing gaps in visual reasoning. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on VideoHallu improves recognition of such violations without reducing standard benchmark performance. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, existing visual table understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4 million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88% preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters.

Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCAI2025 Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability as Best Student Paper</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Multimodal Positional Encoding in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23095v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/JJJYmmm/Multimodal-RoPEs.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |
| **[Decoupling Augmentation Bias in Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03367v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

A Psychophysics-Grounded Evaluation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26241v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially, under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans. Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition) that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Open datasets for this long-tailed scenario are scarce. We propose the ROADWork dataset to learn to recognize, observe, analyze, and drive through work zones. State-of-the-art foundation models fail when applied to work zones. Fine-tuning models on our dataset significantly improves perception and navigation in work zones. With ROADWork dataset, we discover new work zone images with higher precision (+32.5%) at a much higher rate (12.8$\times$) around the world. Open-vocabulary methods fail too, whereas fine-tuned detectors improve performance (+32.2 AP). Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to describe work zones, but fine-tuning substantially improves performance (+36.7 SPICE). Beyond fine-tuning, we show the value of simple techniques. Video label propagation provides additional gains (+2.6 AP) for instance segmentation. While reading work zone signs, composing a detector and text spotter via crop-scaling improves performance +14.2% 1-NED). Composing work zone detections to provide context further reduces hallucinations (+3.9 SPICE) in VLMs. We predict navigational goals and compute drivable paths from work zone videos. Incorporating road work semantics ensures 53.6% goals have angular error (AE) < 0.5 (+9.9 %) and 75.3% pathways have AE < 0.5 (+8.1 %).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

Integrating these foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a 2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000 expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and leaderboard can be found at https://leggedrobotics.github.io/navitrace_webpage/.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, under review at IEEE conference</p></details> |
| **[LEGO-Eval: Towards Fine-Grained Evaluation on Synthesizing 3D Embodied Environments with Tool Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03001v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Existing approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision, demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation, and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[XR-1: Towards Versatile Vision-Language-Action Models via Learning Unified Vision-Motion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02776v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However, existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii) aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

| **[Prompt to Restore, Restore to Prompt: Cyclic Prompting for Universal Adverse Weather Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09013v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal adverse weather removal (UAWR) seeks to address various weather degradations within a unified framework. Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIP against Agent: Malicious Image Patches Hijacking Multimodal OS Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10809v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Flat to Hierarchical: Extracting Sparse Representations with Matching Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03093v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help identify said features and gain further insights into neural network representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest. Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

This paper addresses the critical yet unexplored inferential privacy threat, the risk of inferring sensitive personal attributes over the data. To address this gap, we crowdsourced a dataset of 508 everyday personal videos from 58 individuals. We then conducted a benchmark study evaluating VLM inference capabilities against human performance. Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1) VLMs possess superhuman inferential capabilities, significantly outperforming human evaluators, leveraging a shift from object recognition to behavioral inference from temporal streams. (2) Inferential risk is strongly correlated with factors such as video characteristics and prompting strategies. (3) VLM-driven explanation towards the inference is unreliable, as we revealed a disconnect between the model-generated explanations and evidential impact, identifying ubiquitous objects as misleading confounders.</p></details> |  |

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

While WCAG-EM offers a structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict anatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a comprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing spanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23 disease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image to generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical images. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets is our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge with a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural plausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative refinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K includes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference learning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically validated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a foundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image editing models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at [https://github.com/richardChenzhihui/med-banana-50k].</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking the Thinking Mode of Multimodal Large Language Models in Clinical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03328v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode") alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these "dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |

Like professionals in the creative industries, this generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis.

| **[Struct2D: A Perception-Guided Framework for Spatial Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04220v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlocking spatial reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can MLLMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source MLLMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source MLLM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in MLLMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, code link: https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |
| **[Agent-Omni: Test-Time Multimodal Reasoning via Model Coordination for Understanding Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02834v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

| **[QG-CoC: Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03206v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[ALTo: Adaptive-Length Tokenizer for Autoregressive Mask Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16495v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While humans effortlessly draw visual objects and shapes by adaptively allocating attention based on their complexity, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain constrained by rigid token representations. Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that ALToLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with adaptive token cost on popular segmentation benchmarks. Code and models are released at https://github.com/yayafengzi/ALToLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[WOD-E2E: Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving in Challenging Long-tail Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26125v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of handling complex real-world situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations. More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning (MAR) Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through "drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems, annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large language models, including strongest private models as well as strong open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts. However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning on MIRA.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[LLEXICORP: End-user Explainability of Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02720v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability. To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders. We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |

To address data scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA (avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion, our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework. Trained on SuperRS-VQA and HighRS-VQA, GeoLLaVA-8K sets a new state-of-the-art on the XLRS-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neurl...</summary><p>NeurlPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[UniChange: Unifying Change Detection with Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02607v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

| **[Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | ICCV2025 Workshop |
| **[Uniworld-V2: Reinforce Image Editing with Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning and MLLM Implicit Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16888v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. \texttt{UniWorld-V2}, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available to support further research.</p></details> |  |

However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, EMNLP25 Accepted</p></details> |
