| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A newly identified systematic error in our data processing pipeline has affected the calculation and reporting of AUC metrics (notably in Tables [1, 2]). This significantly impacts our main experimental results and conclusions, compromising their reliability.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MissionGNN: Hierarchical Multimodal GNN-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition with Mission-Specific Knowledge Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18815v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. We present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel Bogdoll and Jan Imhof contributed equally.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Networking Systems for Video Anomaly Detection: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10347v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work.

| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[CyberV: Cybernetics for Test-time Scaling in Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07971v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time, lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0% improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for dynamic video understanding. The code is released at https://github.com/marinero4972/CyberV.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLog: Video-Language Models by Generative Retrieval of Narration Vocabulary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09402v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human daily activities can be concisely narrated as sequences of routine events (e.g., turning off an alarm) in video streams, forming an event vocabulary. Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's flexible upgrading over narration vocabulary. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand).

| **[Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization via Dual-Prior Collaborative Learning Guided by Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08466v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities. Our dataset and code are available upon request.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneRAG: Scene-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07600v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content, confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super Encoding Network: Recursive Association of Multi-Modal Encoders for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07576v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently, multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association (RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%, and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video approach.</p></details> |  |

Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose AdaReTaKe, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench.

Inspired by the success of large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results, which achieves impressive performance improvements.

We pretrain VideoPrism on a heterogeneous corpus containing 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M video clips with noisy parallel text (e.g., ASR transcripts). The pretraining approach improves upon masked autoencoding by global-local distillation of semantic video embeddings and a token shuffling scheme, enabling VideoPrism to focus primarily on the video modality while leveraging the invaluable text associated with videos. We extensively test VideoPrism on four broad groups of video understanding tasks, from web video question answering to CV for science, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 31 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks.

Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps, enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for finegrained audiovisual segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on INTERSPEECH2025</p></details> |

In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

| **[VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06097v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.</p></details> |  |

We propose a systematic evaluation framework and evaluate several language-only and video large language models (video-LLMs) on this benchmark. We observe a performance gap in language-only and video-LLMs, especially on questions focusing on temporal ordering, thus identifying a research gap in the area of long-context video understanding.

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains.

To address these limitations, we introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories (e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds, enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We propose APVR (Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

| **[Vision Transformers Don't Need Trained Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08010v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code: https://avdravid.github.io/test-time-registers</p></details> |

To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2) brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hidden-plain-sight.github.io/</p></details> |

However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

| **[Decoupling the Image Perception and Multimodal Reasoning for Reasoning Segmentation with Digital Twin Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07943v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text, enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mimicking or Reasoning: Rethinking Multi-Modal In-Context Learning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07936v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts. While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception- and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as intended in MM-ICL.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM2Auto: Auto Annotation Using FLASH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07850v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications, which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics)</p></details> |
| **[Image Reconstruction as a Tool for Feature Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07803v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models. Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations. Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are available in GitHub.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

However, these benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse-grained annotations, limiting their ability to reveal how models perform under real-world conditions, where query granularity varies. Motivated by this gap, we examine how dataset granularity and query perturbations affect retrieval performance and robustness across four architecturally diverse VLMs (ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT). Using both standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k) and their fine-grained variants, we show that richer captions consistently enhance retrieval, especially in text-to-image tasks, where we observe an average improvement of 16.23%, compared to 6.44% in image-to-text. To assess robustness, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations and conduct extensive experiments, revealing that while perturbations typically degrade performance, they can also unexpectedly improve retrieval, exposing nuanced model behaviors. Notably, word order emerges as a critical factor -- contradicting prior assumptions of model insensitivity to it. Our results highlight variation in model robustness and a dataset-dependent relationship between caption granularity and perturbation sensitivity and emphasize the necessity of evaluating models on datasets of varying granularity.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS, which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets, significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods. It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight. 22 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Language-Vision Planner and Executor for Text-to-Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07778v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer, Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRE Suite: Geo-localization Inference via Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models and Enhanced Reasoning Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18700v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArchiLense: A Framework for Quantitative Analysis of Architectural Styles Based on Vision Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07739v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVADE: Multimodal Benchmark for Evasive Content Detection in E-Commerce Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17654v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content. However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities: Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling, termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++ validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene Exploration by Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17641v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active perception enables robots to dynamically gather information by adjusting their viewpoints, a crucial capability for interacting with complex, partially observable environments. In this paper, we present AP-VLM, a novel framework that combines active perception with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to guide robotic exploration and answer semantic queries. Using a 3D virtual grid overlaid on the scene and orientation adjustments, AP-VLM allows a robotic manipulator to intelligently select optimal viewpoints and orientations to resolve challenging tasks, such as identifying objects in occluded or inclined positions. We evaluate our system on two robotic platforms: a 7-DOF Franka Panda and a 6-DOF UR5, across various scenes with differing object configurations. Our results demonstrate that AP-VLM significantly outperforms passive perception methods and baseline models, including Toward Grounded Common Sense Reasoning (TGCSR), particularly in scenarios where fixed camera views are inadequate. The adaptability of AP-VLM in real-world settings shows promise for enhancing robotic systems' understanding of complex environments, bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level control.</p></details> |  |

Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100 images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization, validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality (e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

| **[Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model for Efficient Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07627v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities. However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition, EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input. Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency, paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable visual understanding at the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional Autonomous Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07564v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |

However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://penghao-wu.github.io/GUI_Reflection/</p></details> |

These limitations could be more severe for models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0% improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for dynamic video understanding. The code is released at https://github.com/marinero4972/CyberV.</p></details> |  |

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs, providing a more nuanced assessment of their capabilities.

While recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning (RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks. Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase data diversity to further improve model performance.</p></details> |  |

In some specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around, but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets (image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000 reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD, addressing the data shortage issue in specific domain MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Considering that the model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and various weakness that models encountered during the development process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization via Dual-Prior Collaborative Learning Guided by Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08466v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |

| **[SOLIDGEO: Measuring Multimodal Spatial Math Reasoning in Solid Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21177v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics and plays a crucial role in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt to Protection: A Comparative Study of Multimodal LLMs in Construction Hazard Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07436v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However, despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more reliable AI-assisted safety systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Visual Mathematics in Multimodal LLMs: A Multilingual Benchmark Based on the Kangaroo Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07418v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral, Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably, Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance. Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable to align their outputs with the given answer options.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Hallucination at a Glance: Controlled Visual Edits and Fine-Grained Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07227v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences, leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute, count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines, including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Perception Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07218v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on Computer Use Agents</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Model: Data Contamination and Dynamic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07202v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA, captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima) falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task "ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data (extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from spurious leakage or overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAP-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Surgical Action Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07196v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research. The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the 1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152 strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5, Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mitigating Behavioral Hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models for Sequential Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07184v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining descriptive accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcing Video Reasoning with Focused Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24718v3)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning, particularly through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved multimodal large language models for complex reasoning tasks. However, two critical limitations persist: 1) they often produce unfocused, verbose reasoning chains that obscure salient spatiotemporal cues and 2) binary rewarding fails to account for partially correct answers, resulting in high reward variance and inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose TW-GRPO, a novel framework that enhances visual reasoning with focused thinking and dense reward granularity. Specifically, we employs a token weighting mechanism that prioritizes tokens with high informational density (estimated by intra-group information entropy), suppressing redundant tokens like generic reasoning prefixes. Furthermore, we reformulate RL training by shifting from single-choice to multi-choice QA tasks, where soft rewards enable finer-grained gradient estimation by distinguishing partial correctness. Additionally, we propose question-answer inversion, a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse multi-choice samples from existing benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several video reasoning and general understanding benchmarks. Notably, TW-GRPO achieves 50.4\% accuracy on CLEVRER (18.8\% improvement over Video-R1) and 65.8\% on MMVU.
