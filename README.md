| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: (i) for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences; (ii) regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analysis, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. Some experimentations are been made to compare these two architectural configurations with each other, and evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis and surveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. To address these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires no training and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm without physical contact. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

We hypothesize that the representation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to successfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this approach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer computational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within video surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model based on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in human-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less than 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach constitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with prior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the results we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art results on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at GCPR 2024, after peer review.

However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06428v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS.

A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding.

We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully reproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Long-VITA</p></details> |

This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination.

| **[LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy). We hope our WorldSense can provide a platform for evaluating the ability in constructing and understanding coherent contexts from omni-modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseVLM: Visual Token Sparsification for Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04417v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually bear a significant amount of computational overhead despite sparsity of information in them when compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Gumpest/SparseVLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.</p></details> |  |

We propose MaxInfo, a training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which selects and retains the most representative frames from the input video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. It also achieves a 3.47% improvement for LLaVA-Video-72B. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.</p></details> |  |

We design several distinct tasks including single-shot video captioning, multi-shot video summarization, and multi-shot video question answering. Preliminary experiments show some challenges to generate a long and comprehensive video summary for multi-shot videos.

While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples. AIN demonstrates state-of-the-art Arabic performance, while also possessing strong English-language visual capabilities. On the recent CAMEL-Bench benchmark comprising 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding, our AIN demonstrates strong performance with the 7B model outperforming GPT-4o by an absolute gain of 3.4% averaged over eight domains and 38 sub-domains.

To endow autonomous systems with such a holistic perception, learning how to correlate concepts, abstract knowledge across diverse tasks, and leverage tasks synergies when learning novel skills is essential. A significant step in this direction is EgoPack, a unified framework for understanding human activities across diverse tasks with minimal overhead. EgoPack promotes information sharing and collaboration among downstream tasks, essential for efficiently learning new skills. In this paper, we introduce Hier-EgoPack, which advances EgoPack by enabling reasoning also across diverse temporal granularities, which expands its applicability to a broader range of downstream tasks. To achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical architecture for temporal reasoning equipped with a GNN layer specifically designed to tackle the challenges of multi-granularity reasoning effectively.

However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video understanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA consists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials, which total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a taxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus: skill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that the best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on factual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%, respectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks. Our work highlights the need to improve the agentic abilities of long-context multimodal models and provides a testbed for future development with long-context video agents.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Top-Down Reasoning: An Explainable Multi-Agent Approach for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17331v4)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, to comprehensively improve Vision Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA), several methods have been proposed to further reinforce the inference capabilities of VLMs to independently tackle VQA tasks rather than some methods that only utilize VLMs as aids to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods ignore the rich common-sense knowledge inside the given VQA image sampled from the real world. Thus, they cannot fully use the powerful VLM for the given VQA question to achieve optimal performance. Attempt to overcome this limitation and inspired by the human top-down reasoning process, i.e., systematically exploring relevant issues to derive a comprehensive answer, this work introduces a novel, explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by leveraging the expansive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of VLMs themselves. Specifically, our framework comprises three agents, i.e., Responder, Seeker, and Integrator, to collaboratively answer the given VQA question by seeking its relevant issues and generating the final answer in such a top-down reasoning process. The VLM-based Responder agent generates the answer candidates for the question and responds to other relevant issues. The Seeker agent, primarily based on LLM, identifies relevant issues related to the question to inform the Responder agent and constructs a Multi-View Knowledge Base (MVKB) for the given visual scene by leveraging the build-in world knowledge of LLM. The Integrator agent combines knowledge from the Seeker agent and the Responder agent to produce the final VQA answer. Extensive and comprehensive evaluations on diverse VQA datasets with a variety of VLMs demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our framework over the baseline method in the zero-shot setting without extra training cost.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Probing Perceptual Constancy in Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10273v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual constancy is the ability to maintain stable perceptions of objects despite changes in sensory input, such as variations in distance, angle, or lighting. This ability is crucial for recognizing visual information in a dynamic world, making it essential for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, whether VLMs are currently and theoretically capable of mastering this ability remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated 33 VLMs using 253 experiments across three domains: color, size, and shape constancy. The experiments included single-image and video adaptations of classic cognitive tasks, along with novel tasks in in-the-wild conditions, to evaluate the models' recognition of object properties under varying conditions. We found significant variability in VLM performance, with models performance in shape constancy clearly dissociated from that of color and size constancy.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a `leaky modality mix,' where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q\&A pairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications. Using the same pipeline, but substituting our trained contextual captioner for GPT-4V, we also release the larger VisCon-1M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

Recently, the advent of vision-language models (VLM) has heightened interest in enhancing OOD detection for VLM through few-shot tuning. However, existing methods mainly focus on optimizing global prompts, ignoring refined utilization of local information with regard to outliers. Motivated by this, we freeze global prompts and introduce Local-Prompt, a novel coarse-to-fine tuning paradigm to emphasize regional enhancement with local prompts. Our method comprises two integral components: global prompt guided negative augmentation and local prompt enhanced regional regularization. The former utilizes frozen, coarse global prompts as guiding cues to incorporate negative augmentation, thereby leveraging local outlier knowledge. The latter employs trainable local prompts and a regional regularization to capture local information effectively, aiding in outlier identification. We also propose regional-related metric to empower the enrichment of OOD detection. Moreover, since our approach explores enhancing local prompts only, it can be seamlessly integrated with trained global prompts during inference to boost the performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our method. Notably, our method reduces average FPR95 by 5.17% against state-of-the-art method in 4-shot tuning on challenging ImageNet-1k dataset, even outperforming 16-shot results of previous methods.

As such, there is a growing need to audit these models to ensure that they generate desirable, task-appropriate images. However, systematically inspecting the associations between prompts and generated content in a human-understandable way remains challenging. To address this, we propose Concept2Concept, a framework where we characterize conditional distributions of vision language models using interpretable concepts and metrics that can be defined in terms of these concepts. This characterization allows us to use our framework to audit models and prompt-datasets. To demonstrate, we investigate several case studies of conditional distributions of prompts, such as user-defined distributions or empirical, real-world distributions. Lastly, we implement Concept2Concept as an open-source interactive visualization tool to facilitate use by non-technical end-users.

| **[Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning with Adaptive Skill Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10148v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS achieves up to 30\% higher win rates than state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in symmetric scenarios.</p></details> |  |

For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cross-Lingual Explanation of Artwork in Large-scale Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01584v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the performance of Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) improves, they are increasingly capable of responding in multiple languages, and there is an expectation that the demand for explanations generated by LVLMs will grow. However, pre-training of Vision Encoder and the integrated training of LLMs with Vision Encoder are mainly conducted using English training data, leaving it uncertain whether LVLMs can completely handle their potential when generating explanations in languages other than English. In addition, multilingual QA benchmarks that create datasets using machine translation have cultural differences and biases, remaining issues for use as evaluation tasks. To address these challenges, this study created an extended dataset in multiple languages without relying on machine translation. This dataset that takes into account nuances and country-specific phrases was then used to evaluate the generation explanation abilities of LVLMs. Furthermore, this study examined whether Instruction-Tuning in resource-rich English improves performance in other languages.

| **[ViRAC: A Vision-Reasoning Agent Head Movement Control Framework in Arbitrary Virtual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10046v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating lifelike virtual agents capable of interacting with their environments is a longstanding goal in computer graphics. This paper addresses the challenge of generating natural head rotations, a critical aspect of believable agent behavior for visual information gathering and dynamic responses to environmental cues. Although earlier methods have made significant strides, many rely on data-driven or saliency-based approaches, which often underperform in diverse settings and fail to capture deeper cognitive factors such as risk assessment, information seeking, and contextual prioritization. Consequently, generated behaviors can appear rigid or overlook critical scene elements, thereby diminishing the sense of realism. In this paper, we propose \textbf{ViRAC}, a \textbf{Vi}sion-\textbf{R}easoning \textbf{A}gent Head Movement \textbf{C}ontrol framework, which exploits the common-sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-scale models, including Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large-Language Models (LLMs). Rather than explicitly modeling every cognitive mechanism, ViRAC leverages the biases and patterns internalized by these models from extensive training, thus emulating human-like perceptual processes without hand-tuned heuristics. Experimental results in multiple scenarios reveal that ViRAC produces more natural and context-aware head rotations than recent state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitative evaluations show a closer alignment with real human head-movement data, while user studies confirm improved realism and cognitive plausibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRISHUL: Towards Region Identification and Screen Hierarchy Understanding for Large VLM based GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08226v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</p></details> | 8 pages 5 figures |

Our bootstrapping philosophy is to progressively adapt heterogeneous comprehension and generation knowledge to pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This is achieved through a novel heterogeneous low-rank adaptation (H-LoRA) technique, which is complemented by a tailored hierarchical visual perception approach and a three-stage learning strategy. To effectively learn the HealthGPT, we devise a comprehensive medical domain-specific comprehension and generation dataset called VL-Health. Experimental results demonstrate exceptional performance and scalability of HealthGPT in medical visual unified tasks.

| **[AutoSketch: VLM-assisted Style-Aware Vector Sketch Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06860v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[On the robustness of multimodal language model towards distractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09818v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant success in various applications such as visual question answering, their resilience to prompt variations remains an under-explored area. Understanding how distractions affect VLMs is crucial for improving their real-world applicability, as inputs could have noisy and irrelevant information in many practical scenarios. This paper aims to assess the robustness of VLMs against both visual and textual distractions in the context of science question answering. Built on the ScienceQA dataset, we developed a new benchmark that introduces distractions in both the visual and textual contexts to evaluate the reasoning capacity of VLMs amid these distractions. Our findings reveal that most-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4, are vulnerable to various types of distractions, experiencing noticeable degradation in reasoning capabilities when confronted with distractions. Notably, models such as InternVL2 demonstrate a higher degree of robustness to these distractions. We also found that models exhibit greater sensitivity to textual distractions than visual ones. Additionally, we explored various mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering, to counteract the impact of distractions. While these strategies improved solution accuracy, our analysis shows that there remain significant opportunities for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13904v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images. Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lxtgh.github.io/project/sa2va</p></details> |
| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires learning of shared representations already in intermediate layers and shared circuitry.</p></details> |  |

Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat.</p></details> |  |

Traditional navigation methods, which depend on high-precision maps, are resource-intensive, while learning-based approaches often struggle with generalization in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes the Openstreetmap-enhanced oPen-air sEmantic Navigation (OPEN) system that combines foundation models with classic algorithms for scalable outdoor navigation. The system uses off-the-shelf OpenStreetMap (OSM) for flexible map representation, thereby eliminating the need for extensive pre-mapping efforts. It also employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend delivery instructions and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for global localization, map updates, and house number recognition. To compensate the limitations of existing benchmarks that are inadequate for assessing last-mile delivery, this work introduces a new benchmark specifically designed for outdoor navigation in residential areas, reflecting the real-world challenges faced by autonomous delivery systems. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the proposed system's efficacy in enhancing navigation efficiency and reliability. To facilitate further research, our code and benchmark are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

| **[MM-RLHF: The Next Step Forward in Multimodal LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10391v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite notable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), most state-of-the-art models have not undergone thorough alignment with human preferences. This gap exists because current alignment research has primarily achieved progress in specific areas (e.g., hallucination reduction), while the broader question of whether aligning models with human preferences can systematically enhance MLLM capability remains largely unexplored. To this end, we introduce MM-RLHF, a dataset containing $\mathbf{120k}$ fine-grained, human-annotated preference comparison pairs. This dataset represents a substantial advancement over existing resources, offering superior size, diversity, annotation granularity, and quality. Leveraging this dataset, we propose several key innovations to improve both the quality of reward models and the efficiency of alignment algorithms. Notably, we introduce a Critique-Based Reward Model, which generates critiques of model outputs before assigning scores, offering enhanced interpretability and more informative feedback compared to traditional scalar reward mechanisms. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Reward Scaling, a method that adjusts the loss weight of each sample according to the reward signal, thereby optimizing the use of high-quality comparison pairs. Our approach is rigorously evaluated across $\mathbf{10}$ distinct dimensions and $\mathbf{27}$ benchmarks, with results demonstrating significant and consistent improvements in model performance. Specifically, fine-tuning LLaVA-ov-7B with MM-RLHF and our alignment algorithm leads to a $\mathbf{19.5}$% increase in conversational abilities and a $\mathbf{60}$% improvement in safety. We have open-sourced the preference dataset, reward model, training and evaluation code, as well as reward modeling and safety benchmarks.

We introduce Amuse, a songwriting assistant that transforms multimodal (image, text, or audio) inputs into chord progressions that can be seamlessly incorporated into songwriters' creative processes. A key feature of Amuse is its novel method for generating coherent chords that are relevant to music keywords in the absence of datasets with paired examples of multimodal inputs and chords. Specifically, we propose a method that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to convert multimodal inputs into noisy chord suggestions and uses a unimodal chord model to filter the suggestions. A user study with songwriters shows that Amuse effectively supports transforming multimodal ideas into coherent musical suggestions, enhancing users' agency and creativity throughout the songwriting process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at CHI 2025.

This report assesses GPT-4o across various tasks to analyze its audio processing and reasoning abilities. We find that GPT-4o exhibits strong knowledge in audio, speech, and music understanding, performing well in tasks like intent classification, spoken command classification, semantic and grammatical reasoning., multilingual speech recognition, and singing analysis. It also shows greater robustness against hallucinations than other large audio-language models (LALMs). However, it struggles with tasks such as audio duration prediction and instrument classification. Additionally, GPT-4o's safety mechanisms cause it to decline tasks like speaker identification, age classification, MOS prediction, and audio deepfake detection. Notably, the model exhibits a significantly different refusal rate when responding to speaker verification tasks on different datasets. This is likely due to variations in the accompanying instructions or the quality of the input audio, suggesting the sensitivity of its built-in safeguards. Finally, we acknowledge that model performance varies with evaluation protocols. This report only serves as a preliminary exploration of the current state of LALMs.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[When Video Coding Meets Multimodal Large Language Models: A Unified Paradigm for Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08093v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing codecs are designed to eliminate intrinsic redundancies to create a compact representation for compression. However, strong external priors from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not been explicitly explored in video compression. Herein, we introduce a unified paradigm for Cross-Modality Video Coding (CMVC), which is a pioneering approach to explore multimodality representation and video generative models in video coding. Specifically, on the encoder side, we disentangle a video into spatial content and motion components, which are subsequently transformed into distinct modalities to achieve very compact representation by leveraging MLLMs. During decoding, previously encoded components and video generation models are leveraged to create multiple encoding-decoding modes that optimize video reconstruction quality for specific decoding requirements, including Text-Text-to-Video (TT2V) mode to ensure high-quality semantic information and Image-Text-to-Video (IT2V) mode to achieve superb perceptual consistency. In addition, we propose an efficient frame interpolation model for IT2V mode via Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) tuning to guarantee perceptual quality, which allows the generated motion cues to behave smoothly. Experiments on benchmarks indicate that TT2V achieves effective semantic reconstruction, while IT2V exhibits competitive perceptual consistency. These results highlight potential directions for future research in video coding.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Benchmark for Crime Surveillance Video Analysis with Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09325v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly analysis in surveillance videos is a crucial topic in computer vision. In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have outperformed task-specific models in various domains. Although MLLMs are particularly versatile, their abilities to understand anomalous concepts and details are insufficiently studied because of the outdated benchmarks of this field not providing MLLM-style QAs and efficient algorithms to assess the model's open-ended text responses. To fill this gap, we propose a benchmark for crime surveillance video analysis with large models denoted as UCVL, including 1,829 videos and reorganized annotations from the UCF-Crime and UCF-Crime Annotation datasets. We design six types of questions and generate diverse QA pairs. Then we develop detailed instructions and use OpenAI's GPT-4o for accurate assessment. We benchmark eight prevailing MLLMs ranging from 0.5B to 40B parameters, and the results demonstrate the reliability of this bench. Moreover, we finetune LLaVA-OneVision on UCVL's training set. The improvement validates our data's high quality for video anomaly analysis.</p></details> |  |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

This survey consolidates recent research on (M)LLM-based GUI agents, highlighting key innovations in data resources, frameworks, and applications. We begin by reviewing representative datasets and benchmarks, followed by an overview of a generalized, unified framework that encapsulates the essential components of prior studies, supported by a detailed taxonomy. Additionally, we explore relevant commercial applications. Drawing insights from existing work, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions.

| **[LLMI3D: MLLM-based 3D Perception from a Single 2D Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07422v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms. However, current 3D perception methods, especially specialized small models, exhibit poor generalization in open scenarios. On the other hand, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak 3D local spatial object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Adversarial Attack on Aligned Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07987v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a universal adversarial attack on multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that leverages a single optimized image to override alignment safeguards across diverse queries and even multiple models. By backpropagating through the vision encoder and language head, we craft a synthetic image that forces the model to respond with a targeted phrase (e.g., ''Sure, here it is'') or otherwise unsafe content-even for harmful prompts. In experiments on the SafeBench benchmark, our method achieves significantly higher attack success rates than existing baselines, including text-only universal prompts (e.g., up to 93% on certain models). We further demonstrate cross-model transferability by training on several multimodal LLMs simultaneously and testing on unseen architectures. Additionally, a multi-answer variant of our approach produces more natural-sounding (yet still malicious) responses. These findings underscore critical vulnerabilities in current multimodal alignment and call for more robust adversarial defenses. We will release code and datasets under the Apache-2.0 license. Warning: some content generated by Multimodal LLMs in this paper may be offensive to some readers.</p></details> | Added an affiliation |
| **[3D-Grounded Vision-Language Framework for Robotic Task Planning: Automated Prompt Synthesis and Supervised Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08903v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in scene understanding and perception tasks, enabling robots to plan and execute actions adaptively in dynamic environments. However, most multimodal large language models lack robust 3D scene localization capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in fine-grained robotic operations. Additionally, challenges such as low recognition accuracy, inefficiency, poor transferability, and reliability hinder their use in precision tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates a 2D prompt synthesis module by mapping 2D images to point clouds, and incorporates a small language model (SLM) for supervising VLM outputs. The 2D prompt synthesis module enables VLMs, trained on 2D images and text, to autonomously extract precise 3D spatial information without manual intervention, significantly enhancing 3D scene understanding. Meanwhile, the SLM supervises VLM outputs, mitigating hallucinations and ensuring reliable, executable robotic control code generation. Our framework eliminates the need for retraining in new environments, thereby improving cost efficiency and operational robustness. Experimental results that the proposed framework achieved a 96.0\% Task Success Rate (TSR), outperforming other methods. Ablation studies demonstrated the critical role of both the 2D prompt synthesis module and the output supervision module (which, when removed, caused a 67\% TSR drop). These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in improving 3D recognition, task planning, and robotic task execution.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |
| **[mmE5: Improving Multimodal Multilingual Embeddings via High-quality Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08468v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark. Our codes, datasets and models are released in https://github.com/haon-chen/mmE5.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey on AI-Generated Media Detection: From Non-MLLM to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05240v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of AI-generated media poses significant challenges to information authenticity and social trust, making reliable detection methods highly demanded. Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.</p></details> |  |

Current AVs, however, still lag behind human drivers in adaptability and performance, often exhibiting overly conservative behaviours and occasionally violating traffic laws. Existing solutions, such as runtime enforcement, mitigate this by automatically repairing the AV's planned trajectory at runtime, but such approaches lack transparency and should be a measure of last resort. It would be preferable for AV repairs to generalise beyond specific incidents and to be interpretable for users. In this work, we propose FixDrive, a framework that analyses driving records from near-misses or law violations to generate AV driving strategy repairs that reduce the chance of such incidents occurring again. These repairs are captured in {\mu}Drive, a high-level domain-specific language for specifying driving behaviours in response to event-based triggers. Implemented for the state-of-the-art autonomous driving system Apollo, FixDrive identifies and visualises critical moments from driving records, then uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with zero-shot learning to generate {\mu}Drive programs. We tested FixDrive on various benchmark scenarios, and found that the generated repairs improved the AV's performance with respect to following traffic laws, avoiding collisions, and successfully reaching destinations. Furthermore, the direct costs of repairing an AV -- 15 minutes of offline analysis and $0.08 per violation -- are reasonable in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Human Skill Generators at Key-Step Levels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08234v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are committed to learning human skill generators at key-step levels. The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos. Finally, a video generation model uses these descriptions and key-step images to generate video clips of the key steps with high temporal consistency. We offer a detailed analysis of the results, hoping to provide more insights on human skill generation. All models and data are available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/KS-Gen.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparsity Meets Similarity: Leveraging Long-Tail Distribution for Dynamic Optimized Token Representation in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01162v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) have achieved significant success in various tasks, but their high computational costs limit widespread application. The main computational burden arises from processing concatenated text and visual tokens in the LLM layer, where input token length directly affects efficiency. Our analysis of visual tokens reveals that their similarity to the CLS token follows a long-tail distribution, with only a few showing high similarity. To address this, we propose a dynamic pruning algorithm that identifies the inflection point in the visual CLS token similarity curve, enabling effective trimming of visual markers to accelerate model performance. Additionally, we perform a second round of pruning in the LLM layer, filtering out low-correlation tokens through the interaction between visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to the original while utilizing only 22% of the original token quantity. Our source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSeek on a Trip: Inducing Targeted Visual Hallucinations via Representation Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07905v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) represent the cutting edge of AI technology, with DeepSeek models emerging as a leading open-source alternative offering competitive performance to closed-source systems. While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their vision-language integration mechanisms introduce specific vulnerabilities. We implement an adapted embedding manipulation attack on DeepSeek Janus that induces targeted visual hallucinations through systematic optimization of image embeddings. Through extensive experimentation across COCO, DALL-E 3, and SVIT datasets, we achieve hallucination rates of up to 98.0% while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM > 0.88) of the manipulated images on open-ended questions. Our analysis demonstrates that both 1B and 7B variants of DeepSeek Janus are susceptible to these attacks, with closed-form evaluation showing consistently higher hallucination rates compared to open-ended questioning. We introduce a novel multi-prompt hallucination detection framework using LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct for robust evaluation. The implications of these findings are particularly concerning given DeepSeek's open-source nature and widespread deployment potential. This research emphasizes the critical need for embedding-level security measures in MLLM deployment pipelines and contributes to the broader discussion of responsible AI implementation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07601v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[EgoTextVQA: Towards Egocentric Scene-Text Aware Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07411v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EgoTextVQA, a novel and rigorously constructed benchmark for egocentric QA assistance involving scene text. EgoTextVQA contains 1.5K ego-view videos and 7K scene-text aware questions that reflect real-user needs in outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping activities. The questions are designed to elicit identification and reasoning on scene text in an egocentric and dynamic environment. With EgoTextVQA, we comprehensively evaluate 10 prominent multimodal large language models. Currently, all models struggle, and the best results (Gemini 1.5 Pro) are around 33% accuracy, highlighting the severe deficiency of these techniques in egocentric QA assistance. Our further investigations suggest that precise temporal grounding and multi-frame reasoning, along with high resolution and auxiliary scene-text inputs, are key for better performance. With thorough analyses and heuristic suggestions, we hope EgoTextVQA can serve as a solid testbed for research in egocentric scene-text QA assistance.</p></details> |  |
