| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MissionGNN: Hierarchical Multimodal GNN-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition with Mission-Specific Knowledge Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18815v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at https://github.com/EavnJeong/IEF-VAD.</p></details> |  |

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

| **[Flash-VStream: Efficient Real-Time Understanding for Long Video Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23825v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunwhw/InstructionBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMa: Modulating Mamba for Adapting Image Foundation Models to Video Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23283v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models (IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately, which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper, we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features. By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.</p></details> | ICML 2025 paper |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown early promise in tackling TVG through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), their abilities to generalize remain limited. To address this, we propose a novel post-training framework that enhances the generalization capabilities of LVLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our contributions span three key directions: (1) Time-R1: we introduce a reasoning-guided post-training framework via RL with verifiable reward to enhance the capabilities of LVLMs on the TVG task. (2) TimeRFT: we explore data-efficient post-training strategies on our curated RL-friendly dataset, which trains the model to progressively comprehend difficult samples, leading to better generalization. (3) TVGBench: we carefully construct a small yet comprehensive benchmark for LVLM evaluation, assessing 11 types of queries and featuring balanced distributions across both videos and queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream datasets using only 2.5K training data, while improving its general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xuboshen.github.io/Time-R1/</p></details> |

While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint manuscript - Project page: https://github.com/aghdamamir/act-align</p></details> |

Although recent training-free approaches have alleviated resource demands by compressing visual features, their reliance on incomplete visual information limits the performance potential. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}ivot \textbf{V}isual information \textbf{R}etrieval (\textbf{APVR}), a training-free framework that hierarchically retrieves and retains sufficient and important visual information. It breakthroughs the memory wall limitation via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs query expansion and iterative spatio-semantic confidence scoring to identify relevant video frames, and Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within up to 1024 pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables the processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validations demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving 64.9\% on LongVideoBench and 68.4\% on VideoMME, which are state-of-the-art results for both training-free and training-based approaches. Meanwhile, our method provides plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges persist in adapting these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

The linear frame sampling strategy, conventionally used by LVLMs, fails to account for the non-linear distribution of key events in video data, often introducing redundant or irrelevant information in longer contexts while risking the omission of critical events in shorter ones. To address this, we propose SelfReS, a non-linear spatiotemporal self-reflective sampling method that dynamically selects key video fragments based on user prompts. Unlike prior approaches, SelfReS leverages the inherently sparse attention maps of LVLMs to define reflection tokens, enabling relevance-aware token selection without requiring additional training or external modules. Experiments demonstrate that SelfReS can be seamlessly integrated into strong base LVLMs, improving long-video task accuracy and achieving up to 46% faster inference speed within the same GPU memory budget.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICCV 2025.

In this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 Figure, 3 Table</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii) By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However, there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing complex procedural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory-enhanced Retrieval Augmentation for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09149v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient long-video understanding~(LVU) remains a challenging task in computer vision. Current long-context vision-language models~(LVLMs) suffer from information loss due to compression and brute-force downsampling. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this issue, their applicability is limited due to explicit query dependency. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel memory-enhanced RAG-based approach called MemVid, which is inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings. Our approach operates in four basic steps: 1) memorizing holistic video information, 2) reasoning about the task's information needs based on memory, 3) retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and 4) focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities while achieving optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiments, MemVid demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to both LVLMs and RAG methods.</p></details> |  |

The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video.

To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/GRPO-CARE</p></details> |

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws.

However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while generating free-form responses remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that jointly attributes LVLM outputs to the most relevant visual evidence and textual signals supporting open-ended VQA. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods and pushing the state-of-the-art in human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning dynamics, analyze systematic human-attention misalignment, diagnose hallucination, expose bias, and ensure transparency.</p></details> |  |

However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation.

A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24000v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/TomSheng21/tta-vlm</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver, prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse, and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence on large, organ-specific annotated datasets.

However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost.

| **[A Closer Look at Conditional Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23856v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes. Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts, improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work, we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

However, these methods often lack interpretability, as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs. To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization.

Specifically, VisTex-OVLM leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM, maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[PAC Bench: Do Foundation Models Understand Prerequisites for Executing Manipulation Policies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23725v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly pivotal for generalist robot manipulation, enabling tasks such as physical reasoning, policy generation, and failure detection. However, their proficiency in these high-level applications often assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a capability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions reliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material, weight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical constraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being closed). Despite the widespread use of VLMs in manipulation tasks, we argue that off-the-shelf models may lack this granular, physically grounded understanding, as such prerequisites are often overlooked during training. To address this critical gap, we introduce PAC Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLMs on their understanding of core Properties, Affordances, and Constraints (PAC) from a task executability perspective. PAC Bench features a diverse dataset with over 30,000 annotations, comprising 673 real-world images (115 object classes, 15 property types, and 1 to 3 affordances defined per class), 100 real-world humanoid-view scenarios, and 120 unique simulated constraint scenarios across four tasks. Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the ability of current VLMs to grasp fundamental physical concepts, highlighting limitations in their suitability for reliable robot manipulation and pointing to key areas for targeted research. PAC Bench also serves as a standardized benchmark for rigorously evaluating physical reasoning in VLMs and guiding the development of more robust, physically grounded models for robotic applications.

While these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness, highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware robustness assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Deepb...</summary><p>Deepbench is available at https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/deepbench</p></details> |
| **[TinyAlign: Boosting Lightweight Vision-Language Models by Mitigating Modal Alignment Bottlenecks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12884v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment. Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance. Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only 40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAI: Caption-Sensitive Attention Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23590v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination. To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only with minimal additional inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23584v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing vision-language models to novel domains: A comprehensive survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18504v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.</p></details> |  |

Unlike large-scale VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

| **[Sanitizing Manufacturing Dataset Labels Using Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23465v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However, large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels, and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings. Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings, followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with minimal human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Cross-modal Backward-compatible Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14715v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

We introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying 3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool usage.

Traditional CCL methods primarily rely on visual features, which limits their effectiveness in complex, multimodal scenarios. In contrast, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promising potential for enhancing CCL by leveraging pre-trained knowledge and fusing multi-modal semantic cues such as text and vision. However, existing approaches struggle to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization strengths of VLMs across diverse modalities. To address these challenges, we propose CalFuse, a framework for feature Calibration enhanced parameter Fusion, which enhances dynamic knowledge fusion. CalFuse introduces a dynamic feature calibration mechanism that iteratively adjusts the contribution of original visual features to the final class decision, thereby preserving the model's intrinsic generalization capability across modalities. Simultaneously, a parameter fusion strategy effectively fuses newly acquired knowledge with prior task parameters, maintaining a balance between acquiring new class representations and preserving old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Most existing caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities. Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level, detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage. The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality, we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets and Models: https://github.com/lxtGH/DenseWorld-1M</p></details> |

Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

| **[Graft: Integrating the Domain Knowledge via Efficient Parameter Synergy for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23940v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy, which leverages both local functional attribution and global information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility. This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models.

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

We present a framework that unifies multimodal understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMReason: An Open-Ended Multi-Modal Multi-Step Reasoning Benchmark for MLLMs Toward AGI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23563v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3) inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended, challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/MMReason.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[OrderChain: Towards General Instruct-Tuning for Stimulating the Ordinal Understanding Ability of MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04801v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they continue to face challenges in achieving competitive performance on ordinal regression (OR; a.k.a. ordinal classification). To address this issue, this paper presents OrderChain, a novel and general prompting paradigm that improves the ordinal understanding ability of MLLMs by specificity and commonality modeling. Specifically, our OrderChain consists of a set of task-aware prompts to facilitate the specificity modeling of diverse OR tasks and a new range optimization Chain-of-Thought (RO-CoT), which learns a commonality way of thinking about OR tasks by uniformly decomposing them into multiple small-range optimization subtasks. Further, we propose a category recursive division (CRD) method to generate instruction candidate category prompts to support RO-CoT automatic optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model with our OrderChain improves baseline LLaVA significantly on diverse OR datasets, e.g., from 47.5% to 93.2% accuracy on the Adience dataset for age estimation, and from 30.0% to 85.7% accuracy on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. Notably, LLaVA with our OrderChain also remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 27% on accuracy and 0.24 on MAE on the Adience dataset. To our best knowledge, our OrderChain is the first work that augments MLLMs for OR tasks, and the effectiveness is witnessed across a spectrum of OR datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing vision-language models to novel domains: A comprehensive survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18504v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Enables MLLMs Learning Novel Tasks Stably](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23508v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (Preprint.

| **[Evaluation of Geolocation Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models and Analysis of Associated Privacy Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23481v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other security threats. Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view imagery. Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to $49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues from visual data. Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text, architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zxyl1003/MLLM-Geolocation-Evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws for Black box Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16782v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial examples usually exhibit good cross-model transferability, enabling attacks on black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters, which are highly threatening in commercial black-box scenarios. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by attacking multiple surrogate models. However, since prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the scaling law of large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we conclude with clear scaling laws that using more surrogate models enhances adversarial transferability. Comprehensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, diverse defended models and multimodal large language models using various adversarial attack methods. Specifically, by scaling law, we achieve 90%+ transfer attack success rate on even proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further visualization indicates that there is also a scaling law on the interpretability and semantics of adversarial perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample then Identify: A General Framework for Risk Control and Assessment in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08174v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 Spotlights</p></details> |
| **[Token Activation Map to Visually Explain Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23270v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The code is available atgithub.com/xmed-lab/TAM.</p></details> | ICCV2025 Accepted |
| **[Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models through Reasoning-based Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23120v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Individuals to Interactions: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models from the Lens of Social Relationship](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23101v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias, particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle, interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for future bias mitigation.</p></details> |  |
