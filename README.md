| **[DUAL-VAD: Dual Benchmarks and Anomaly-Focused Sampling for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11605v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety. However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task. Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages in IEEE double-column format, 1 figure, 5 tables.

| **[Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA-Crime: A Synthetic Dataset and Generation Framework for Fatal Violence Detection with Adversarial Snippet-Level Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08232v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset and the data generation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |
| **[MissionHD: Data-Driven Refinement of Reasoning Graph Structure through Hyperdimensional Causal Path Encoding and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Video Anomaly Detection via Deep Learning: Human, Vehicle, and Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14203v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |

| **[ChronoForge-RL: Chronological Forging through Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15800v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames. Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B parameter alternatives.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Data-Efficient Learning for Generalizable Surgical Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10215v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.</p></details> |  |
| **[TennisTV: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Understand Tennis Rallies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15602v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[EyePCR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Fine-Grained Perception, Knowledge Comprehension and Clinical Reasoning in Ophthalmic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15596v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stron...</summary><p>Strong accept by NeurIPS2025 Reviewers and AC, but reject by PC.

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dense Video Understanding with Gated Residual Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14199v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cinéaste: A Fine-grained Contextual Movie Question Answering Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14227v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Culturally-diverse Multilingual Multimodal Video Benchmark & Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07032v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13255v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DSRBench: A Comprehensive 3D Spatial Reasoning Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07825v4)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning abilities by balancing data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images from uncommon 6D viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about future development of LMMs with strong spatial reasoning abilities.

| **[Open-ended Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12145v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines online temporal action localization with free-form description generation. Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE (Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key step in that direction.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at https://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Bridging Vision Language Models and Symbolic Grounding for Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11862v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for straightforward sports queries and ii) Deliberative Reasoning for more complex ones. To bridge the knowledge gap between general-purpose models and domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA and Diving-QA, derived from the FineGym and FineDiving datasets, enabling diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FineQuest achieves state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks as well as the existing SPORTU dataset, while maintains strong general VideoQA capabilities.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[GLaVE-Cap: Global-Local Aligned Video Captioning with Vision Expert Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11360v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning, which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning, and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption. Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages "shots" as the fundamental units of video understanding. This includes extending temporal context to neighbouring shots and incorporating film grammar devices, such as shot scales and thread structures, to guide AD generation. Our method is compatible with both open-source and proprietary Visual-Language Models (VLMs), integrating expert knowledge from add-on modules without requiring additional training of the VLMs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance among all prior training-free approaches and even surpass fine-tuned methods on several benchmarks. To evaluate the quality of predicted ADs, we introduce a new evaluation measure -- an action score -- specifically targeted to assessing this important aspect of AD. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that treats automatic frameworks as AD generation assistants and asks them to generate multiple candidate ADs for selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order. However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy. Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t. absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing surveys largely classify models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span, hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding.</p></details> | Research report |

While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU. In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general reasoning benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall reasoning performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.

Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining. By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\% performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%. Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical, plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented as a poster at the Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems (SafeMM-AI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMs Can Compensate for Deficiencies in Visual Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05439v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Randomized Smoothing Meets Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16088v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action (e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP'25 full version, including appendix (proofs, additional experiments)</p></details> |

Although recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage: https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compose by Focus: Scene Graph-based Atomic Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16053v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations, thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea, we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused" scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner. Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Meme-Based Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15389v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

| **[CLIPTTA: Robust Contrastive Vision-Language Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14312v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse. We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75 datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more stable performance across diverse shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07620v4)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.</p></details> |  |

Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.</p></details> |  |

However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further review, we identified that our dataset requires optimization to ensure research reliability and accuracy.

CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal.

However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark. Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.</p></details> |  |

However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation, enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware, adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of these VLMs critically depends on high-quality image-text training data that captures rich semantic relationships between visual content and language descriptions. Unlike natural images, RS lacks large-scale interleaved image-text pairs from web data, making data collection challenging. While current approaches rely primarily on rule-based methods or flagship VLMs for data synthesis, a systematic framework for automated quality assessment of such synthetically generated RS vision-language data is notably absent. To fill this gap, we propose a novel score model trained on large-scale RS vision-language preference data for automated quality assessment. Our empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuning CLIP or advanced VLMs (e.g., Qwen2-VL) with the top 30% of data ranked by our score model achieves superior accuracy compared to both full-data fine-tuning and CLIP-score-based ranking approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications of our scoring model for reinforcement learning (RL) training and best-of-N (BoN) test-time scaling, enabling significant improvements in VLM performance for RS tasks.

Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15695v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.</p></details> | IEEE Submission |

Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the main conference, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[SightSound-R1: Cross-Modal Reasoning Distillation from Vision to Audio Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15661v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large audio-language models (LALMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art audio understanding, their reasoning capability in complex soundscapes still falls behind large vision-language models (LVLMs). Compared to the visual domain, one bottleneck is the lack of large-scale chain-of-thought audio data to teach LALM stepwise reasoning. To circumvent this data and modality gap, we present SightSound-R1, a cross-modal distillation framework that transfers advanced reasoning from a stronger LVLM teacher to a weaker LALM student on the same audio-visual question answering (AVQA) dataset. SightSound-R1 consists of three core steps: (i) test-time scaling to generate audio-focused chains of thought (CoT) from an LVLM teacher, (ii) audio-grounded validation to filter hallucinations, and (iii) a distillation pipeline with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for the LALM student. Results show that SightSound-R1 improves LALM reasoning performance both in the in-domain AVQA test set as well as in unseen auditory scenes and questions, outperforming both pretrained and label-only distilled baselines. Thus, we conclude that vision reasoning can be effectively transferred to audio models and scaled with abundant audio-visual data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.</p></details> |  |

However, we observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior. While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models (LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning, allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions, without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaseReward: A Strong Baseline for Multimodal Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16127v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model} and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}. Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

While prior efforts have incorporated modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Language-Instructed Reasoning for Group Activity Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16054v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP> tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the <ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made progress in SER. However, MLLMs still suffer from hallucination and misclassification problems in complex emotion reasoning. To address these problems, we propose an MLLM-based framework called EmoQ, which generates query embeddings that fuse multimodal information through an EmoQ-Former and uses multi-objective affective learning (MAL) to achieve co-optimization. The framework also provides a soft-prompt injection strategy to inject multimodal representations into the LLM. This end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, providing a new multimodal fusion paradigm for SER.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stron...</summary><p>Strong accept by NeurIPS2025 Reviewers and AC, but reject by PC.

To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[OSPO: Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02015v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled models to perform both understanding and generation of multimodal data in a unified manner. However, achieving a fine-grained alignment between input prompts and generated images remains a major challenge especially in text-to-image generation. Therefore, recent works have introduced self-improving mechanisms based on self-generated data and self-feedback to efficiently mitigate this challenge without relying on external large-scale data or models. However, existing self-improving approaches have not focused on fine-grained visual details especially at the object level in generating training data or providing a feedback, and thus they still struggle to resolve the object hallucination problem in text-to-image generation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO), a self-improving framework for enhancing object-level text-image alignment. OSPO is designed to explicitly address the need for constructing and leveraging object-level hard negative data and an object-centric optimization in improving object-specific fidelity. In specific, OSPO consists of: (1) Initial Prompt Generation (2) Hard Preference Pair Generation (3) Filtering and Selection (4) Object-centric Preference Optimization with Conditional Preference Loss. Extensive experiments on compositional image generation benchmarks demonstrate that OSPO significantly improves fine-grained alignment in text-to-image generation, surpassing not only prior self-improving methods but also diffusion-based specialized image generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-R1: Advancing Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities of MLLMs via Visual Perception Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07218v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the harmlessness of four leading MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus) when exposed to adversarial prompts across text-only and multimodal formats. A team of 26 red teamers generated 726 prompts targeting three harm categories: illegal activity, disinformation, and unethical behaviour. These prompts were submitted to each model, and 17 annotators rated 2,904 model outputs for harmfulness using a 5-point scale. Results show significant differences in vulnerability across models and modalities. Pixtral 12B exhibited the highest rate of harmful responses (~62%), while Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the most resistant (~10%). Contrary to expectations, text-only prompts were slightly more effective at bypassing safety mechanisms than multimodal ones. Statistical analysis confirmed that both model type and input modality were significant predictors of harmfulness. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has primarily focused on textual or visual-textual sarcasm, comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection on English (MUStARD++) and Chinese (MCSD 1.0) in zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings. In addition to direct classification, we explore models as feature encoders, integrating their representations through a collaborative gating fusion module. Experimental results show that audio-based models achieve the strongest unimodal performance, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform unimodal and trimodal models. Furthermore, MLLMs such as Qwen-Omni show competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance. Our findings highlight the potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding.</p></details> |  |

With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.</p></details> |  |

Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.</p></details> |  |

Among the essential capabilities required for AGI, creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively, making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs' behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations.
