| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DAMS:Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20629v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ACM MM 2025; Code: https://github.com/YihuaJerry/EventVAD</p></details> |
| **[HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17394v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 |
| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP.

| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

| **[DisTime: Distribution-based Time Representation for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24329v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in general video understanding, Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) face challenges in precise temporal localization due to discrete time representations and limited temporally aware datasets. Existing methods for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values, add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs. DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks. Code and data are released at https://github.com/josephzpng/DisTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[AIM: Adaptive Inference of Multi-Modal LLMs via Token Merging and Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03248v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[PEVLM: Parallel Encoding for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19651v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, their application to long video understanding remains hindered by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{PEVLM}, a fine-tuning-free parallel encoding method designed to enhance the prefilling efficiency of VLMs in long video scenarios. PEVLM partitions the input video into context blocks with a shared sink block, while preserving sequential position embeddings to align the attention weight distribution with that of Full-Attention. This design reduces attention complexity from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ where $T$ is the number of frames and $N$ the number of tokens per frame, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art models and benchmarks demonstrate that PEVLM consistently outperforms existing parallel encoding approaches, achieving up to \textbf{7.47x} speedup in attention computation and reducing end-to-end latency by \textbf{40\%}. Remarkably, PEVLM not only maintains high accuracy, but in some settings even surpasses Full-Attention performance. Under strict latency constraints, it achieves substantial gains, improving accuracy from \textbf{23.26\%} to \textbf{61.03\%}. These results underscore the effectiveness of PEVLM for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HumanSAM: Classifying Human-centric Forgery Videos in Human Spatial, Appearance, and Motion Anomaly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19924v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class forgery classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, existing models primarily focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses, restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video and image understanding.

| **[BEARCUBS: A benchmark for computer-using web agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07919v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "smallbut mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. We find that ChatGPT Agent significantly outperforms other computer-using agents with an overall accuracy of 65.8% (compared to e.g., Operator's 23.4%), showcasing substantial progress in tasks involving real computer use, such as playing web games and navigating 3D environments. Nevertheless, closing the gap to human performance requires improvements in areas like fine control, complex data filtering, and execution speed. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[VideoMind: An Omni-Modal Video Dataset with Intent Grounding for Deep-Cognitive Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18552v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample. VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition. The data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab, https://github.com/cdx-cindy/VideoMind.</p></details> | 7 pages; 14 figures |

Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored. To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flash-VStream: Efficient Real-Time Understanding for Long Video Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23825v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video.

Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset, SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions, achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics, with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks.

However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</p></details> |  |

We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

These captions offer detailed narrations with precise timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially extended for advertising and marketing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVAM Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus on the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with significantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding without requiring training on long video data.

VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of 3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1. Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10% across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding.

This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features. However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

| **[Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning All-Rounder: Rethinking and Improving Inference Efficiency for Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06458v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational costs pose a significant barrier to wide application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios. The code for this work is publicly available at https://github.com/ASGO-MM/Pruning-All-Rounder.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV 25 |

However, the long visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models. Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across different pruning ratios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models.

This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.</p></details> | 28 pages, 36 figures |

Our research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks; and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model adaptation.</p></details> | 2 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, current evaluations of vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a region-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims. In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions. Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues. We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success. Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically informed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 & CVinW @ CVPR 2025 (Spotlight).

We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method, Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable and generalizable systems for real-world applications.

We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages |

We also utilize multiple pre-trained models and ensemble techniques to boost the model's performance.

However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance.

While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability.

Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection.

| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPCC: A Novel Benchmark for Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23382v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13 advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only 21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally, we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios. Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities.

| **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models' (LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%, substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property. Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as in model robustness to some defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta CLIP 2: A Worldwide Scaling Recipe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22062v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[StoryTeller: Improving Long Video Description through Global Audio-Visual Character Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07076v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are largely limited to processing short, seconds-long videos and struggle with generating coherent descriptions for extended video spanning minutes or more. Long video description introduces new challenges, such as consistent character identification and plot-level descriptions incorporating both visual and audio information. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create StoryQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on StoryQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on StoryQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-AGILE: Advancing GUI Agents with Effective Reinforcement Learning and Precise Inference-Time Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22025v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20766v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions, while this pipeline can be optimized end-to-end by the GRPO algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation across two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained model not only outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization to unseen datasets. Critically, the model's performance surpasses that of the more advanced MLLM used to provide the feedback signal during training. This work establishes a self-improvement paradigm that offers a viable path to robust, generalizable models without reliance on explicit supervision. Code will be available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.</p></details> |  |

While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations. In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

However, existing methods typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and (3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal large language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile, existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data. Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while preserving general performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
