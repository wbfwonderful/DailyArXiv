| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: (i) for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences; (ii) regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analysis, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. Some experimentations are been made to compare these two architectural configurations with each other, and evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPatchCore: An Effective Method to Memorize Normality for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16225v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial task in video analysis and surveillance within computer vision. Currently, VAD is gaining attention with memory techniques that store the features of normal frames. The stored features are utilized for frame reconstruction, identifying an abnormality when a significant difference exists between the reconstructed and input frames. However, this approach faces several challenges due to the simultaneous optimization required for both the memory and encoder-decoder model. These challenges include increased optimization difficulty, complexity of implementation, and performance variability depending on the memory size. To address these challenges,we propose an effective memory method for VAD, called VideoPatchCore. Inspired by PatchCore, our approach introduces a structure that prioritizes memory optimization and configures three types of memory tailored to the characteristics of video data. This method effectively addresses the limitations of existing memory-based methods, achieving good performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method requires no training and is straightforward to implement, making VAD tasks more accessible. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-VideoPatchCore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm without physical contact. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

We hypothesize that the representation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to successfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this approach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer computational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within video surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model based on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in human-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less than 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach constitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with prior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the results we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art results on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at GCPR 2024, after peer review.

We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully reproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Long-VITA</p></details> |

This work first introduces a comprehensive analysis that identifies four key characteristics essential for the effective adaptation of RoPE to video, which have not been fully considered in prior work. As part of our analysis, we introduce a challenging V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors) task, which adds periodic distractors into V-NIAH. The V-NIAH-D task demonstrates that previous RoPE variants, lacking appropriate temporal dimension allocation, are easily misled by distractors. Based on our analysis, we introduce \textbf{VideoRoPE}, with a \textit{3D structure} designed to preserve spatio-temporal relationships. VideoRoPE features \textit{low-frequency temporal allocation} to mitigate periodic oscillations, a \textit{diagonal layout} to maintain spatial symmetry, and \textit{adjustable temporal spacing} to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. VideoRoPE consistently surpasses previous RoPE variants, across diverse downstream tasks such as long video retrieval, video understanding, and video hallucination. Our code will be available at \href{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}{https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoRoPE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[LV-XAttn: Distributed Cross-Attention for Long Visual Inputs in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02406v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-attention is commonly adopted in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual information into the language backbone. However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing benchmarks, our WorldSense has several features: (i) collaboration of omni-modality, we design the evaluation tasks to feature a strong coupling of audio and video, requiring models to effectively utilize the synergistic perception of omni-modality; (ii) diversity of videos and tasks, WorldSense encompasses a diverse collection of 1,662 audio-visual synchronised videos, systematically categorized into 8 primary domains and 67 fine-grained subcategories to cover the broad scenarios, and 3,172 multi-choice QA pairs across 26 distinct tasks to enable the comprehensive evaluation; (iii) high-quality annotations, all the QA pairs are manually labeled by 80 expert annotators with multiple rounds of correction to ensure quality. Based on our WorldSense, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results indicate that existing models face significant challenges in understanding real-world scenarios (48.0% best accuracy).

| **[SparseVLM: Visual Token Sparsification for Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04417v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually bear a significant amount of computational overhead despite sparsity of information in them when compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy.

Evaluating the quality of video QA and video caption data quality for training video large language models (VideoLLMs) is an essential challenge. Although various methods have been proposed for assessing video caption quality, there remains a lack of dedicated evaluation methods for Video QA. To address this gap, we introduce EVQAScore, a reference-free method that leverages keyword extraction to assess both video caption and video QA data quality. Additionally, we incorporate frame sampling and rescaling techniques to enhance the efficiency and robustness of our evaluation, this enables our score to evaluate the quality of extremely long videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (32.8 for Kendall correlation and 42.3 for Spearman correlation, 4.7 and 5.9 higher than the previous method PAC-S++) on the VATEX-EVAL benchmark for video caption evaluation. Furthermore, by using EVQAScore for data selection, we achieved SOTA results with only 12.5\% of the original data volume, outperforming the previous SOTA method PAC-S and 100\% of data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaxInfo: A Training-Free Key-Frame Selection Method Using Maximum Volume for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03183v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) often rely on uniform frame sampling for video understanding, but this approach frequently fails to capture critical information due to frame redundancy and variations in video content. We propose MaxInfo, a training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which selects and retains the most representative frames from the input video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. It also achieves a 3.47% improvement for LLaVA-Video-72B. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.</p></details> |  |

While Arabic LLMs have seen notable progress, Arabic LMMs remain largely unexplored, often narrowly focusing on a few specific aspects of the language and visual understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIN-the Arabic Inclusive Multimodal Model-designed to excel across diverse domains. AIN is an English-Arabic bilingual LMM designed to excel in English and Arabic, leveraging carefully constructed 3.6 million high-quality Arabic-English multimodal data samples.

To endow autonomous systems with such a holistic perception, learning how to correlate concepts, abstract knowledge across diverse tasks, and leverage tasks synergies when learning novel skills is essential. A significant step in this direction is EgoPack, a unified framework for understanding human activities across diverse tasks with minimal overhead. EgoPack promotes information sharing and collaboration among downstream tasks, essential for efficiently learning new skills. In this paper, we introduce Hier-EgoPack, which advances EgoPack by enabling reasoning also across diverse temporal granularities, which expands its applicability to a broader range of downstream tasks. To achieve this, we propose a novel hierarchical architecture for temporal reasoning equipped with a GNN layer specifically designed to tackle the challenges of multi-granularity reasoning effectively.

| **[VideoWebArena: Evaluating Long Context Multimodal Agents with Video Understanding Web Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19100v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos are often used to learn or extract the necessary information to complete tasks in ways different than what text and static imagery alone can provide. However, many existing agent benchmarks neglect long-context video understanding, instead focusing on text or static image inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoWebArena (VideoWA), a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of long-context multimodal agents for video understanding. VideoWA consists of 2,021 web agent tasks based on manually crafted video tutorials, which total almost four hours of content. For our benchmark, we define a taxonomy of long-context video-based agent tasks with two main areas of focus: skill retention and factual retention. While skill retention tasks evaluate whether an agent can use a given human demonstration to complete a task efficiently, the factual retention task evaluates whether an agent can retrieve instruction-relevant information from a video to complete a task. We find that the best model achieves 13.3% success on factual retention tasks and 45.8% on factual retention QA pairs, far below human performance at 73.9% and 79.3%, respectively. On skill retention tasks, long-context models perform worse with tutorials than without, exhibiting a 5% performance decrease in WebArena tasks and a 10.3% decrease in VisualWebArena tasks. Our work highlights the need to improve the agentic abilities of long-context multimodal models and provides a testbed for future development with long-context video agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on our proposed LongerVideos benchmark-comprising over 160 videos totaling 134+ hours across lecture, documentary, and entertainment categories-VideoRAG demonstrates substantial performance compared to existing RAG alternatives and long video understanding methods.

| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Our framework augments video Q-formers by allowing them to process unbounded video contexts efficiently and without requiring additional training. Through continuous attention, our approach dynamically allocates higher granularity to the most relevant video segments, forming "sticky" memories that evolve over time.

To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully reproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing. We hope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights for the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/VITA-MLLM/Long-VITA</p></details> |

However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have approached this as a perception prediction problem, we formulate it as scene-aware 3D occupancy reconstruction with geometry and semantics. In this work, we propose OccGS, a novel 3D Occupancy reconstruction framework utilizing Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussian Splatting in a zero-shot manner. Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Few-Shot Continual Learning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04098v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE {\em benchmark}, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE {\em evaluator}. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive paradigm, termed UniAff, that integrates 3D object-centric manipulation and task understanding in a unified formulation. Specifically, we constructed a dataset labeled with manipulation-related key attributes, comprising 900 articulated objects from 19 categories and 600 tools from 12 categories. Furthermore, we leverage MLLMs to infer object-centric representations for manipulation tasks, including affordance recognition and reasoning about 3D motion constraints. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings indicate that UniAff significantly improves the generalization of robotic manipulation for tools and articulated objects. We hope that UniAff will serve as a general baseline for unified robotic manipulation tasks in the future.

However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX'25; 22 pages, 28 figures;</p></details> |
| **[DiPEx: Dispersing Prompt Expansion for Class-Agnostic Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14924v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-agnostic object detection (OD) can be a cornerstone or a bottleneck for many downstream vision tasks. Despite considerable advancements in bottom-up and multi-object discovery methods that leverage basic visual cues to identify salient objects, consistently achieving a high recall rate remains difficult due to the diversity of object types and their contextual complexity. In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1\% in AR and achieving a 21.3\% AP improvement over SAM. The code is available at https://github.com/jason-lim26/DiPEx.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</p></details> |  |

However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseVLM: Visual Token Sparsification for Efficient Vision-Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04417v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision-language models (VLMs), visual tokens usually bear a significant amount of computational overhead despite sparsity of information in them when compared to text tokens. To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Gumpest/SparseVLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449v5)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, but also figures, page layouts, tables, or even fonts. Since modern retrieval systems mainly rely on the textual information they extract from document pages to index documents -often through lengthy and brittle processes-, they struggle to exploit key visual cues efficiently. This limits their capabilities in many practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieval tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and practical settings. The inherent complexity and performance shortcomings of modern systems motivate a new concept; doing document retrieval by directly embedding the images of the document pages. We release ColPali, a Vision Language Model trained to produce high-quality multi-vector embeddings from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically simpler, faster and end-to-end trainable. We release models, data, code and benchmarks under open licenses at https://hf.co/vidore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Regression models achieve high pose accuracy but struggle with model-to-image alignment due to the lack of explicit 2D-3D correspondences. In contrast, optimization-based methods align 3D models to 2D observations but are prone to local minima and depth ambiguity. In this work, we leverage large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate interactive body part descriptions, which serve as implicit constraints to enhance 3D perception and limit the optimization space. Specifically, we formulate monocular human mesh recovery as a distribution adaptation task by integrating both 2D observations and language descriptions. To bridge the gap between text and 3D pose signals, we first train a text encoder and a pose VQ-VAE, aligning texts to body poses in a shared latent space using contrastive learning. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion-based framework to refine the initial parameters guided by gradients derived from both 2D observations and text descriptions. Finally, the model can produce poses with accurate 3D perception and image consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p></details> | 19 pages |

In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, existing ERG research is predominantly confined to the singleton text modality, limiting its effectiveness since human emotions are inherently conveyed through multiple modalities. To combat this, we introduce an avatar-based Multimodal ERG (MERG) task, entailing rich text, speech, and facial vision information. We first present a large-scale high-quality benchmark dataset, \textbf{AvaMERG}, which extends traditional text ERG by incorporating authentic human speech audio and dynamic talking-face avatar videos, encompassing a diverse range of avatar profiles and broadly covering various topics of real-world scenarios. Further, we deliberately tailor a system, named \textbf{Empatheia}, for MERG. Built upon a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with multimodal encoder, speech and avatar generators, Empatheia performs end-to-end MERG, with Chain-of-Empathetic reasoning mechanism integrated for enhanced empathy understanding and reasoning. Finally, we devise a list of empathetic-enhanced tuning strategies, strengthening the capabilities of emotional accuracy and content, avatar-profile consistency across modalities. Experimental results on AvaMERG data demonstrate that Empatheia consistently shows superior performance than baseline methods on both textual ERG and MERG. Overall, this work is expected to pioneer the MERG research by introducing a novel benchmark and an end-to-end model, laying a solid foundation for future advancements in multimodal empathetic response generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TheWebConf (WWW) 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches such as API-based and GUI-based agents are far from satisfactory at accuracy and efficiency aspects. Instead, we advocate to endow LLMs with access to the software internals (source code and runtime context) and the permission to dynamically inject generated code into software for execution. In such a whitebox setting, one may better leverage the software context and the coding ability of LLMs. We then present an overall design architecture and case studies on two popular web-based desktop applications. We also give in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions. We deem that such a new paradigm has the potential to fundamentally overturn the existing software agent design, and finally creating a digital world in which software can comprehend, operate, collaborate, and even think to meet complex user needs.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their extensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local deployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based multimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three language-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA). Our approach introduces two key innovations: a bi-directional vision-language adapter that aligns multimodal inputs for pixel-level language understanding and a depth fusion branch that incorporates geometric cues to facilitate robot grasping predictions. Experiment results demonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with existing CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA tasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on simple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending complex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present in the workspace.

However, in applications with large visual inputs, such as video understanding, processing a large number of visual tokens in cross-attention layers leads to high memory demands and often necessitates distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Existing distributed attention mechanisms face significant communication overheads, making cross-attention layers a critical bottleneck for efficient training and inference of MLLMs. To address this, we propose LV-XAttn, a distributed, exact cross-attention mechanism with minimal communication overhead. We observe that in applications involving large visual inputs the size of the query block is typically much smaller than that of the key-value blocks. Thus, in LV-XAttn we keep the large key-value blocks locally on each GPU and exchange smaller query blocks across GPUs. We also introduce an efficient activation recomputation technique enabling support for longer visual context. We theoretically analyze the communication benefits of LV-XAttn and show that it can achieve speedups for a wide range of models. Our evaluations with mPLUG-Owl3 and OpenFlamingo models find that LV-XAttn achieves up to 5.58$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities.

Compared with generation-only models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), U-MLLMs may raise new questions about bias in their outputs, which can be affected by their unified capabilities. This gap is particularly concerning given the under-explored risk of propagating harmful stereotypes. In this paper, we benchmark the latest U-MLLMs and find that most exhibit significant demographic biases, such as gender and race bias. To better understand and mitigate this issue, we propose a locate-then-fix strategy, where we audit and show how the individual model component is affected by bias. Our analysis shows that bias originates primarily from the language model. More interestingly, we observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon in U-MLLMs, where understanding bias appears minimal, but generation bias remains substantial. Thus, we propose a novel balanced preference model to balance the demographic distribution with synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic bias while preserving semantic fidelity. We hope our findings underscore the need for more holistic interpretation and debiasing strategies of U-MLLMs in the future.</p></details> |  |

To align MLLMs with human visual perception process, PerPO employs discriminative rewarding to gather diverse negative samples, followed by listwise preference optimization to rank them.By utilizing the reward as a quantitative margin for ranking, our method effectively bridges generative preference optimization and discriminative empirical risk minimization. PerPO significantly enhances MLLMs' visual discrimination capabilities while maintaining their generative strengths, mitigates image-unconditional reward hacking, and ensures consistent performance across visual tasks. This work marks a crucial step towards more perceptually aligned and versatile MLLMs. We also hope that PerPO will encourage the community to rethink MLLM alignment strategies.</p></details> |  |

There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slow-thinking systems. To address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning with long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this work is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be transferred across modalities or domains. This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems.

However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach $60\%$ accuracy.

However, despite significant progress, current scientific reasoning models still struggle with generalization across domains and often fall short of multimodal perception. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate text, images, and other modalities, present an exciting opportunity to overcome these limitations and enhance scientific reasoning. Therefore, this position paper argues that MLLMs can significantly advance scientific reasoning across disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. First, we propose a four-stage research roadmap of scientific reasoning capabilities, and highlight the current state of MLLM applications in scientific reasoning, noting their ability to integrate and reason over diverse data types. Second, we summarize the key challenges that remain obstacles to achieving MLLM's full potential. To address these challenges, we propose actionable insights and suggestions for the future.

However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent innovations have led to specialized models for various CXR interpretation tasks, these solutions often operate in isolation, limiting their practical utility in clinical practice. We present MedRAX, the first versatile AI agent that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art CXR analysis tools and multimodal large language models into a unified framework. MedRAX dynamically leverages these models to address complex medical queries without requiring additional training. To rigorously evaluate its capabilities, we introduce ChestAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark containing 2,500 complex medical queries across 7 diverse categories. Our experiments demonstrate that MedRAX achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both open-source and proprietary models, representing a significant step toward the practical deployment of automated CXR interpretation systems.

| **[CognArtive: Large Language Models for Automating Art Analysis and Decoding Aesthetic Elements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04353v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Art, as a universal language, can be interpreted in diverse ways, with artworks embodying profound meanings and nuances. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the availability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) raise the question of how these transformative models can be used to assess and interpret the artistic elements of artworks. While research has been conducted in this domain, to the best of our knowledge, a deep and detailed understanding of the technical and expressive features of artworks using LLMs has not been explored. In this study, we investigate the automation of a formal art analysis framework to analyze a high-throughput number of artworks rapidly and examine how their patterns evolve over time. We explore how LLMs can decode artistic expressions, visual elements, composition, and techniques, revealing emerging patterns that develop across periods. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, emphasizing their ability to process vast quantities of art-related data and generate insightful interpretations. Due to the exhaustive and granular nature of the results, we have developed interactive data visualizations, available online https://cognartive.github.io/, to enhance understanding and accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartMoE: Mixture of Expert Connector for Advanced Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03277v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02458v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Multimodal Model Stealing Attacks via Adversarial Domain Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02438v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are becoming an instrumental part of healthcare systems, assisting medical personnel with decision making and results analysis. Models for radiology report generation are able to interpret medical imagery, thus reducing the workload of radiologists. As medical data is scarce and protected by privacy regulations, medical MLLMs represent valuable intellectual property. However, these assets are potentially vulnerable to model stealing, where attackers aim to replicate their functionality via black-box access. So far, model stealing for the medical domain has focused on classification; however, existing attacks are not effective against MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Domain Alignment (ADA-STEAL), the first stealing attack against medical MLLMs. ADA-STEAL relies on natural images, which are public and widely available, as opposed to their medical counterparts. We show that data augmentation with adversarial noise is sufficient to overcome the data distribution gap between natural images and the domain-specific distribution of the victim MLLM. Experiments on the IU X-RAY and MIMIC-CXR radiology datasets demonstrate that Adversarial Domain Alignment enables attackers to steal the medical MLLM without any access to medical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Multimodal Reasoning with MCTS-Automated Structured Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02339v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but still face challenges in complex visual reasoning. While recent efforts attempt to enhance MLLMs' reasoning by incorporating OpenAI o1-like structured thinking through explicit search structures or teacher-guided distillation, they often struggle to balance performance and efficiency. A critical limitation is their heavy reliance on extensive data and search spaces, resulting in low-efficiency implicit insight extraction and data utilization. To address this, we propose AStar, an Automated Structured thinking paradigm for multimodal reasoning via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). AStar automatically derives high-level cognitive reasoning patterns from limited data using MCTS-powered hierarchical structures. Building on these explicit patterns, we design a unified reasoning framework that seamlessly integrates models' internal reasoning capabilities and external reasoning guidelines, enabling efficient inference with minimal tree iterations. This novel paradigm strikes a compelling balance between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate AStar's effectiveness, achieving superior accuracy (54.0$\%$) on the MathVerse benchmark with a 7B backbone, surpassing GPT-4o (50.2$\%$) while maintaining substantial data and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[EALD-MLLM: Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos with Multi-modal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00574v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion AI is the ability of computers to understand human emotional states. Existing works have achieved promising progress, but two limitations remain to be solved: 1) Previous studies have been more focused on short sequential video emotion analysis while overlooking long sequential video. However, the emotions in short sequential videos only reflect instantaneous emotions, which may be deliberately guided or hidden. In contrast, long sequential videos can reveal authentic emotions; 2) Previous studies commonly utilize various signals such as facial, speech, and even sensitive biological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram). However, due to the increasing demand for privacy, developing Emotion AI without relying on sensitive signals is becoming important. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we construct a dataset for Emotion Analysis in Long-sequential and De-identity videos called EALD by collecting and processing the sequences of athletes' post-match interviews. In addition to providing annotations of the overall emotional state of each video, we also provide the Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL) annotations for each player. NFBL is an inner-driven emotional expression and can serve as an identity-free clue to understanding the emotional state. Moreover, we provide a simple but effective baseline for further research. More precisely, we evaluate the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with de-identification signals (e.g., visual, speech, and NFBLs) to perform emotion analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) MLLMs can achieve comparable, even better performance than the supervised single-modal models, even in a zero-shot scenario; 2) NFBL is an important cue in long sequential emotion analysis. EALD will be available on the open-source platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPIC: Position-Independent Multimodal Context Caching System for Efficient MLLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01960v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The context caching technique is employed to accelerate the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) inference by prevailing serving platforms currently. However, this approach merely reuses the Key-Value (KV) cache of the initial sequence of prompt, resulting in full KV cache recomputation even if the prefix differs slightly. This becomes particularly inefficient in the context of interleaved text and images, as well as multimodal retrieval-augmented generation. This paper proposes position-independent caching as a more effective approach for multimodal information management. We have designed and implemented a caching system, named MPIC, to address both system-level and algorithm-level challenges. MPIC stores the KV cache on local or remote disks when receiving multimodal data, and calculates and loads the KV cache in parallel during inference. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we have incorporated integrated reuse and recompute mechanisms within the system. The experimental results demonstrate that MPIC can achieve up to 54% reduction in response time compared to existing context caching systems, while maintaining negligible or no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, the first version</p></details> |
