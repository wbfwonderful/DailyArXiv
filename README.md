| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[VADMamba: Exploring State Space Models for Fast Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21169v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) methods are mostly CNN-based or Transformer-based, achieving impressive results, but the focus on detection accuracy often comes at the expense of inference speed. The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work. Code is available at https://github.com/jLooo/VADMamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Networking Systems for Video Anomaly Detection: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10347v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD.

| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Contours -- A Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19588v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection prior art is rooted on the assumption that abnormal events can be mostly regarded as a result of uncommon human behavior. Opposed to utilizing skeleton representations of humans, however, we investigate the potential of learning recurrent motion patterns of normal human behavior using 2D contours. Keeping all advantages of pose-based methods, such as increased object anonymization, the shift from human skeletons to contours is hypothesized to leave the opportunity to cover more object categories open for future research. We propose formulating the problem as a regression and a classification task, and additionally explore two distinct data representation techniques for contours. To further reduce the computational complexity of Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection solutions, all methods in this study are based on shallow Neural Networks from the field of Deep Learning, and evaluated on the three most prominent benchmark datasets within Video Anomaly Detection and their human-related counterparts, totaling six datasets. Our results indicate that this novel perspective on Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection marks a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18808v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Anomize: Better Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18094v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14329v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify human behaviors that deviate from normal. At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/HuVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection models aim to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask is considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly score. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world VAD), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions through two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide given labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate SOTA performance. Data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[UCF-Crime-DVS: A Novel Event-Based Dataset for Video Anomaly Detection with Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12905v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection plays a significant role in intelligent surveillance systems. To enhance model's anomaly recognition ability, previous works have typically involved RGB, optical flow, and text features. Recently, dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have emerged as a promising technology, which capture visual information as discrete events with a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. It reduces data redundancy and enhances the capture capacity of moving objects compared to conventional camera. To introduce this rich dynamic information into the surveillance field, we created the first DVS video anomaly detection benchmark, namely UCF-Crime-DVS. To fully utilize this new data modality, a multi-scale spiking fusion network (MSF) is designed based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). This work explores the potential application of dynamic information from event data in video anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on UCF-Crime-DVS and its superior performance compared to other models, establishing a new baseline for SNN-based weakly supervised video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Structured Keywords](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10653v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in surveillance video using keywords by leveraging foundational models' feature representation generalization capabilities. We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |

| **[Does Your Vision-Language Model Get Lost in the Long Video Sampling Dilemma?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12496v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, efficiently processing long videos remains a challenge due to the ``Sampling Dilemma'': low-density sampling risks missing critical information, while high-density sampling introduces redundancy. To address this issue, we introduce LSDBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LVLMs on long-video tasks by constructing high Necessary Sampling Density (NSD) questions, where NSD represents the minimum sampling density required to accurately answer a given question. LSDBench focuses on dense, short-duration actions to rigorously assess the sampling strategies employed by LVLMs. To tackle the challenges posed by high-NSD questions, we propose a novel Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Sampling (RHS) framework, which combines global localization of question-relevant cues with local dense sampling for precise inference. Additionally, we develop a lightweight Semantic-Guided Frame Selector to prioritize informative frames, enabling RHS to achieve comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer sampled frames. Together, our LSDBench and RHS framework address the unique challenges of high-NSD long-video tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating and improving LVLMs in this domain. Our benchmark and evaluation codes has been released at: https://github.com/dvlab-research/LSDBench</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame-Voyager: Learning to Query Frames for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03226v4)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding tasks. However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Camera-ready Version</p></details> |
| **[ReWind: Understanding Long Videos with Instructed Learnable Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15556v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for applications requiring integrated understanding textual and visual information. However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose Mobile-VideoGPT, an efficient multimodal framework designed to operate with fewer than a billion parameters. Unlike traditional video large multimodal models (LMMs), Mobile-VideoGPT consists of lightweight dual visual encoders, efficient projectors, and a small language model (SLM), enabling real-time throughput. To further improve efficiency, we present an Attention-Based Frame Scoring mechanism to select the key-frames, along with an efficient token projector that prunes redundant visual tokens and preserves essential contextual cues. We evaluate our model across well-established six video understanding benchmarks (e.g., MVBench, EgoSchema, NextQA, and PercepTest). Our results show that Mobile-VideoGPT-0.5B can generate up to 46 tokens per second while outperforming existing state-of-the-art 0.5B-parameter models by 6 points on average with 40% fewer parameters and more than 2x higher throughput.

Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning.

Our primary focus is on highly efficient model scales (1B and 3B), demonstrating that even relatively small Video LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on video understanding, meeting the demand for mobile-friendly models. Experimental results demonstrate that SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves superior performance on a wide range of video and image tasks, with robust results at all model sizes (ranging from 1B to 7B). Notably, SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results in long-form video understanding (e.g., LongVideoBench and MLVU) and excels at small scales across various video benchmarks.</p></details> | Technical report |

However, their effectiveness in long-form video analysis is constrained by limited context windows. Traditional approaches, such as uniform frame sampling, often inevitably allocate resources to irrelevant content, diminishing their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce BOLT, a method to BOost Large VLMs without additional Training through a comprehensive study of frame selection strategies. First, to enable a more realistic evaluation of VLMs in long-form video understanding, we propose a multi-source retrieval evaluation setting. Our findings reveal that uniform sampling performs poorly in noisy contexts, underscoring the importance of selecting the right frames. Second, we explore several frame selection strategies based on query-frame similarity and analyze their effectiveness at inference time. Our results show that inverse transform sampling yields the most significant performance improvement, increasing accuracy on the Video-MME benchmark from 53.8% to 56.1% and MLVU benchmark from 58.9% to 63.4%.

We propose a systematic approach that organizes videos into a hierarchical tree structure for QA generation and incorporates self-revision mechanisms to ensure high-quality QA pairs. Each QA pair in LongViTU features: 1) long-term context (average certificate length of 4.6 minutes); 2) rich knowledge and condensed reasoning (commonsense, causality, planning, etc.)). We also offer explicit timestamp annotations of relevant events for each QA pair. We have conducted extensive human studies on LongViTU, and the results prove the quality of our dataset. To better evaluate the challenges posed by LongViTU's emphasis on long-term context and condensed reasoning, we manually curate a subset of LongViTU into a benchmark. Evaluations using a state-of-the-art open-source model (LongVU), a proprietary model (Gemini-1.5-Pro), and human annotators yield GPT-4 scores of 49.9, 52.3, and 81.0, respectively, underscoring the substantial difficulty presented by LongViTU questions. Performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LongVU and LLaVA-Video on LongViTU data results in average performance gains of 2.5% and 3.7%, respectively, across a suite of long video understanding benchmarks (EgoSchema, VideoMME-Long, MLVU, LVBench).</p></details> |  |
| **[M-LLM Based Video Frame Selection for Efficient Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19680v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) show promising results in video reasoning. Popular Multi-Modal Large Language Model (M-LLM) frameworks usually apply naive uniform sampling to reduce the number of video frames that are fed into an M-LLM, particularly for long context videos. However, it could lose crucial context in certain periods of a video, so that the downstream M-LLM may not have sufficient visual information to answer a question. To attack this pain point, we propose a light-weight M-LLM -based frame selection method that adaptively select frames that are more relevant to users' queries. In order to train the proposed frame selector, we introduce two supervision signals (i) Spatial signal, where single frame importance score by prompting a M-LLM; (ii) Temporal signal, in which multiple frames selection by prompting Large Language Model (LLM) using the captions of all frame candidates. The selected frames are then digested by a frozen downstream video M-LLM for visual reasoning and question answering. Empirical results show that the proposed M-LLM video frame selector improves the performances various downstream video Large Language Model (video-LLM) across medium (ActivityNet, NExT-QA) and long (EgoSchema, LongVideoBench) context video question answering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, understanding long videos remains challenging as the models can only process a finite number of frames in a single inference, potentially omitting crucial visual information. To address the challenge, we propose generating multiple predictions through visual context sampling, followed by a scoring mechanism to select the final prediction. Specifically, we devise a bin-wise sampling strategy that enables MLLMs to generate diverse answers based on various combinations of keyframes, thereby enriching the visual context. To determine the final prediction from the sampled answers, we employ a self-reward by linearly combining three scores: (1) a frequency score indicating the prevalence of each option, (2) a marginal confidence score reflecting the inter-intra sample certainty of MLLM predictions, and (3) a reasoning score for different question types, including clue-guided answering for global questions and temporal self-refocusing for local questions. The frequency score ensures robustness through majority correctness, the confidence-aligned score reflects prediction certainty, and the typed-reasoning score addresses cases with sparse key visual information using tailored strategies. Experiments show that this approach covers the correct answer for a high percentage of long video questions, on seven datasets show that our method improves the performance of three MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

The linear frame sampling strategy, conventionally used by LVLMs, fails to account for the non-linear distribution of key events in video data, often introducing redundant or irrelevant information in longer contexts while risking the omission of critical events in shorter ones. To address this, we propose SelfReS, a non-linear spatiotemporal self-reflective sampling method that dynamically selects key video fragments based on user prompts. Unlike prior approaches, SelfReS leverages the inherently sparse attention maps of LVLMs to define reflection tokens, enabling relevance-aware token selection without requiring additional training or external modules. Experiments demonstrate that SelfReS can be seamlessly integrated into strong base LVLMs, improving long-video task accuracy and achieving up to 46% faster inference speed within the same GPU memory budget.</p></details> |  |

The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

This novel task aims to generate temporally fine-grained captions that not only accurately describe each frame but also capture the subtle progression of actions throughout a video sequence. Despite the strong capabilities of existing leading vision language models, they often struggle to discern the nuances of frame-wise differences. To address this, we propose ProgressCaptioner, a captioning model designed to capture the fine-grained temporal dynamics within an action sequence. Alongside, we develop the FrameCap dataset to support training and the FrameCapEval benchmark to assess caption quality. The results demonstrate that ProgressCaptioner significantly surpasses leading captioning models, producing precise captions that accurately capture action progression and set a new standard for temporal precision in video captioning. Finally, we showcase practical applications of our approach, specifically in aiding keyframe selection and advancing video understanding, highlighting its broad utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025, Project website: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/ProgressCaptioner/</p></details> |

However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets.

HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks.

This limitation stems from a lack of specialized ADL video instruction-tuning datasets and insufficient modality integration to capture discriminative action representations. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for curating ADL datasets, creating ADL-X, a multiview, multimodal RGBS instruction-tuning dataset. Additionally, we introduce LLAVIDAL, an LLVM integrating videos, 3D skeletons, and HOIs to model ADL's complex spatiotemporal relationships. For training LLAVIDAL a simple joint alignment of all modalities yields suboptimal results; thus, we propose a Multimodal Progressive (MMPro) training strategy, incorporating modalities in stages following a curriculum. We also establish ADL MCQ and video description benchmarks to assess LLVM performance in ADL tasks. Trained on ADL-X, LLAVIDAL achieves state-of-the-art performance across ADL benchmarks.

To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose ego2exo knowledge distillation to learn ego-augmented exp representations. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo videos, which are impractical to collect at scale. To address this, we propose Skeleton-guided Synthetic Ego Generation (SK-EGO), which leverages human skeleton motion to generate synthetic ego views from exocentric videos. To enhance the ego representation of LVLMs trained on synthetic data, we develop a domain-agnostic bootstrapped ego2exo strategy that effectively transfers knowledge from real ego-exo pairs to synthetic ego-exo pairs, while mitigating domain misalignment. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed Ego-in-Exo PerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos.

However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (ACVUBench) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. Specifically, ACVUBench incorporates 2,662 videos spanning 18 different domains with rich auditory information, together with over 13k high-quality human annotated or validated question-answer pairs. Moreover, ACVUBench introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos.

In this paper, we present PAVE, a flexible framework for adapting pre-trained Video LLMs to downstream tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio, 3D cues, or multi-view videos. PAVE introduces lightweight adapters, referred to as "patches," which add a small number of parameters and operations to a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In doing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support diverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D reasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video understanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance of the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while incurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters.

However, this area has been underexplored due to the substantial differences in perspective, motion patterns, and context between ego and exo views. In this paper, we propose a novel masked ego-exo modeling that promotes both causal temporal dynamics and cross-view alignment, called Bootstrap Your Own Views (BYOV), for fine-grained view-invariant video representation learning from unpaired ego-exo videos. We highlight the importance of capturing the compositional nature of human actions as a basis for robust cross-view understanding. Specifically, self-view masking and cross-view masking predictions are designed to learn view-invariant and powerful representations concurrently.

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for co-speech gesture understanding in the wild. Specifically, we propose three new tasks and benchmarks to evaluate a model's capability to comprehend gesture-text-speech associations: (i) gesture-based retrieval, (ii) gestured word spotting, and (iii) active speaker detection using gestures. We present a new approach that learns a tri-modal speech-text-video-gesture representation to solve these tasks. By leveraging a combination of global phrase contrastive loss and local gesture-word coupling loss, we demonstrate that a strong gesture representation can be learned in a weakly supervised manner from videos in the wild. Our learned representations outperform previous methods, including large vision-language models (VLMs), across all three tasks. Further analysis reveals that speech and text modalities capture distinct gesture-related signals, underscoring the advantages of learning a shared tri-modal embedding space.

In contrast, text data is abundant and inexpensive, prompting the question: can high-quality multimodal training data be synthesized purely from text? To tackle this, we propose a cross-integrated three-stage multimodal data synthesis framework, which generates two datasets: Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction. In Stage 1: Diverse Caption Data Synthesis, we construct 1.2M semantically diverse high-quality captions by expanding sparse caption seeds using large language models (LLMs). In Stage 2: Instruction-Tuning Data Generation, we further process 471K captions into multi-turn instruction-tuning tasks to support complex reasoning. Finally, in Stage 3: Modality Representation Transfer, these textual captions representations are transformed into visual representations, resulting in diverse synthetic image representations. This three-stage process enables us to construct Unicorn-1.2M for pretraining and Unicorn-471K-Instruction for instruction-tuning, without relying on real images. By eliminating the dependency on real images while maintaining data quality and diversity, our framework offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for VLMs training.

By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

However, these methods typically rely on a single VLM to align the feature spaces of 3D models within a common language space, which limits the potential of 3D models to leverage the diverse spatial and semantic capabilities encapsulated in various foundation models. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal and Uncertainty-aware Agglomeration for Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding dubbed CUA-O3D, the first model to integrate multiple foundation models-such as CLIP, DINOv2, and Stable Diffusion-into 3D scene understanding. We further introduce a deterministic uncertainty estimation to adaptively distill and harmonize the heterogeneous 2D feature embeddings from these models. Our method addresses two key challenges: (1) incorporating semantic priors from VLMs alongside the geometric knowledge of spatially-aware vision foundation models, and (2) using a novel deterministic uncertainty estimation to capture model-specific uncertainties across diverse semantic and geometric sensitivities, helping to reconcile heterogeneous representations during training. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and Matterport3D demonstrate that our method not only advances open-vocabulary segmentation but also achieves robust cross-domain alignment and competitive spatial perception capabilities.

By integrating chest X-ray images with clinical data, the model addresses the challenges of manual interpretation, improving diagnostic consistency and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: The VLM architecture combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual encoding and a transformer-based text encoder to process clinical context, such as patient histories and treatment records. Cross-modal attention mechanisms align radiographic features with textual information, while the Gemma-3b decoder generates comprehensive diagnostic reports. The model was pre-trained on 5 million paired medical images and texts and fine-tuned using 100,000 chronic TB-specific chest X-rays. Results: The model demonstrated high precision (94 percent) and recall (94 percent) for detecting key chronic TB pathologies, including fibrosis, calcified granulomas, and bronchiectasis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores exceeded 0.93, and Intersection over Union (IoU) values were above 0.91, validating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing TB-related abnormalities. Conclusion: The VLM offers a robust and scalable solution for automated chronic TB diagnosis, integrating radiographic and clinical data to deliver actionable and context-aware insights. Future work will address subtle pathologies and dataset biases to enhance the model's generalizability, ensuring equitable performance across diverse populations and healthcare settings.</p></details> | 10 pages , 3 figures |

This task becomes crucial in ensuring the reliability of detectors in open-world settings. While existing methods have demonstrated success in image-level OOD detection using pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, directly applying such models to object-level OOD detection presents challenges due to the loss of contextual information and reliance on image-level alignment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new method that leverages visual prompts and text-augmented in-distribution (ID) space construction to adapt CLIP for zero-shot object-level OOD detection. Our method preserves critical contextual information and improves the ability to differentiate between ID and OOD objects, achieving competitive performance across different benchmarks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Prompt learning, which fine-tunes prompt embeddings of pretrained models, offers significant advantages in federated settings by reducing computational costs and communication overheads while leveraging the strong performance and generalization capabilities of vision-language models such as CLIP. This paper addresses the intersection of federated learning and prompt learning, particularly for vision-language models. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework, named FLIP, to evaluate federated prompt learning algorithms. FLIP assesses the performance of 8 state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods across 4 federated learning protocols and 12 open datasets, considering 6 distinct evaluation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that prompt learning maintains strong generalization performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings with minimal resource consumption. This work highlights the effectiveness of federated prompt learning in environments characterized by data scarcity, unseen classes, and cross-domain distributional shifts. We open-source the code for all implemented algorithms in FLIP to facilitate further research in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/0-ml/flip</p></details> |
| **[REMAC: Self-Reflective and Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Collaboration for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22122v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic planning, particularly for long-horizon tasks that require a holistic understanding of the environment for task decomposition. Existing methods typically rely on prior environmental knowledge or carefully designed task-specific prompts, making them struggle with dynamic scene changes or unexpected task conditions, e.g., a robot attempting to put a carrot in the microwave but finds the door was closed. Such challenges underscore two critical issues: adaptability and efficiency. To address them, in this work, we propose an adaptive multi-agent planning framework, termed REMAC, that enables efficient, scene-agnostic multi-robot long-horizon task planning and execution through continuous reflection and self-evolution. REMAC incorporates two key modules: a self-reflection module performing pre-condition and post-condition checks in the loop to evaluate progress and refine plans, and a self-evolvement module dynamically adapting plans based on scene-specific reasoning. It offers several appealing benefits: 1) Robots can initially explore and reason about the environment without complex prompt design. 2) Robots can keep reflecting on potential planning errors and adapting the plan based on task-specific insights. 3) After iterations, a robot can call another one to coordinate tasks in parallel, maximizing the task execution efficiency. To validate REMAC's effectiveness, we build a multi-agent environment for long-horizon robot manipulation and navigation based on RoboCasa, featuring 4 task categories with 27 task styles and 50+ different objects. Based on it, we further benchmark state-of-the-art reasoning models, including DeepSeek-R1, o3-mini, QwQ, and Grok3, demonstrating REMAC's superiority by boosting average success rates by 40% and execution efficiency by 52.7% over the single robot baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Your Vision-Language Model Get Lost in the Long Video Sampling Dilemma?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12496v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, efficiently processing long videos remains a challenge due to the ``Sampling Dilemma'': low-density sampling risks missing critical information, while high-density sampling introduces redundancy. To address this issue, we introduce LSDBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LVLMs on long-video tasks by constructing high Necessary Sampling Density (NSD) questions, where NSD represents the minimum sampling density required to accurately answer a given question. LSDBench focuses on dense, short-duration actions to rigorously assess the sampling strategies employed by LVLMs. To tackle the challenges posed by high-NSD questions, we propose a novel Reasoning-Driven Hierarchical Sampling (RHS) framework, which combines global localization of question-relevant cues with local dense sampling for precise inference. Additionally, we develop a lightweight Semantic-Guided Frame Selector to prioritize informative frames, enabling RHS to achieve comparable or superior performance with significantly fewer sampled frames. Together, our LSDBench and RHS framework address the unique challenges of high-NSD long-video tasks, setting a new standard for evaluating and improving LVLMs in this domain. Our benchmark and evaluation codes has been released at: https://github.com/dvlab-research/LSDBench</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks. Traditional targeted adversarial attacks require specific targets and labels, limiting their real-world impact.We present AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that transcends the limitations of conventional attacks through a novel foundation model approach. By pre-training on the massive LAION-400M dataset without label supervision, AnyAttack achieves unprecedented flexibility - enabling any image to be transformed into an attack vector targeting any desired output across different VLMs.This approach fundamentally changes the threat landscape, making adversarial capabilities accessible at an unprecedented scale. Our extensive validation across five open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrates AnyAttack's effectiveness across diverse multimodal tasks. Most concerning, AnyAttack seamlessly transfers to commercial systems including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT, revealing a systemic vulnerability requiring immediate attention.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

An Open-ended Theory of Mind Question Evaluation Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22093v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks; However, their ability to perform Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks such as accurately inferring human intentions, beliefs, and other mental states remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an open-ended question framework to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' performance across diverse categories of ToM tasks. We curated and annotated a benchmark dataset composed of 30 images. We then assessed the performance of four VLMs of varying sizes on this dataset. Our experimental results show that the GPT-4 model outperformed all others, with only one smaller model, GPT-4o-mini, achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we observed that VLMs often struggle to accurately infer intentions in complex scenarios such as bullying or cheating. Moreover, our findings also reveal that smaller models can sometimes infer correct intentions despite relying on incorrect visual cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, accepted by ToM@AAAI25</p></details> |

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models. Moreover, the computational demands of training and fine-tuning multimodal models require significant resources, further complicating their practical application in remote sensing image interpretation tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in vision and multimodal foundation models for remote sensing, focusing on their architecture, training methods, datasets and application scenarios. We discuss the key challenges these models face, such as data alignment, cross-modal transfer learning, and scalability, while also identifying emerging research directions aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of the current landscape of remote sensing foundation models and inspire future research that can push the boundaries of what these models can achieve in real-world applications.

However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |

While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. We introduce CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |

JEEM includes the tasks of image captioning and visual question answering, and features culturally rich and regionally diverse content. This dataset aims to assess the ability of VLMs to generalize across dialects and accurately interpret cultural elements in visual contexts. In an evaluation of five prominent open-source Arabic VLMs and GPT-4V, we find that the Arabic VLMs consistently underperform, struggling with both visual understanding and dialect-specific generation. While GPT-4V ranks best in this comparison, the model's linguistic competence varies across dialects, and its visual understanding capabilities lag behind. This underscores the need for more inclusive models and the value of culturally-diverse evaluation paradigms.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce a new framework that can boost the performance of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, so that they can be used for text-to-image re-ranking. The approach, Enhanced Language-Image Pre-training (ELIP), uses the text query, via a simple MLP mapping network, to predict a set of visual prompts to condition the ViT image encoding. ELIP can easily be applied to the commonly used CLIP, SigLIP and BLIP-2 networks. To train the architecture with limited computing resources, we develop a 'student friendly' best practice, involving global hard sample mining, and curation of a large-scale dataset. On the evaluation side, we set up two new out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, Occluded COCO and ImageNet-R, to assess the zero-shot generalisation of the models to different domains. The results demonstrate that ELIP significantly boosts CLIP/SigLIP/SigLIP-2 text-to-image retrieval performance and outperforms BLIP-2 on several benchmarks, as well as providing an easy means to adapt to OOD datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages in total.

We conduct a user survey to identify adoption patterns and key challenges users face with such technologies. Despite a high adoption rate of these models, our findings highlight concerns related to contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, and complex scene understanding, particularly for individuals who may rely solely on them for visual interpretation. Informed by these results, we collate five user-centred tasks with image and video inputs, including a novel task on Optical Braille Recognition. Our systematic evaluation of twelve MLLMs reveals that further advancements are necessary to overcome limitations related to cultural context, multilingual support, Braille reading comprehension, assistive object recognition, and hallucinations. This work provides critical insights into the future direction of multimodal AI for accessibility, underscoring the need for more inclusive, robust, and trustworthy visual assistance technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks focus primarily on the evaluation of general-purpose CQA but fail to adequately capture domain-specific challenges. We introduce DomainCQA, a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific CQA benchmarks, and demonstrate its effectiveness by developing AstroChart, a CQA benchmark in the field of astronomy. Our evaluation shows that chart reasoning and combining chart information with domain knowledge for deeper analysis and summarization, rather than domain-specific knowledge, pose the primary challenge for existing MLLMs, highlighting a critical gap in current benchmarks. By providing a scalable and rigorous framework, DomainCQA enables more precise assessment and improvement of MLLMs for domain-specific applications.</p></details> | 87 pages, 65 figures |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Although reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise in overcoming these limitations, it encounters two significant challenges: (1) its generalized capacities in multimodal tasks remain largely unexplored, and (2) its training constraints, including the constant Kullback-Leibler divergence or the clamp strategy, often result in suboptimal bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose OThink-MR1, an advanced MLLM equipped with profound comprehension and reasoning capabilities across multimodal tasks. Specifically, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D), which markedly enhances reinforcement learning (RL) performance. For Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, GRPO-D achieves a relative improvement of more than 5.72% over SFT and more than 13.59% over GRPO in same-task evaluation on two adapted datasets. Furthermore, GRPO-D demonstrates remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, with an average relative improvement of more than 61.63% over SFT in cross-task evaluation. These results highlight that the MLLM trained with GRPO-D on one multimodal task can be effectively transferred to another task, underscoring the superior generalized reasoning capabilities of our proposed OThink-MR1 model.</p></details> |  |

Using a causal ToM model, we generate multi-choice video QA instances for the Ego4D dataset to benchmark the ability to predict a camera wearer's goals, beliefs, and next actions. We study the performance of both humans and state of the art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on these three interconnected inference problems. Our evaluation shows that MLLMs achieve close to human-level accuracy on inferring goals from egocentric videos. However, MLLMs (including the largest ones we tested with over 100B parameters) fall short of human performance when inferring the camera wearers' in-the-moment belief states and future actions that are most consistent with the unseen video future. We believe that our results will shape the future design of an important class of egocentric digital assistants which are equipped with a reasonable model of the user's internal mental states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tokenization of Gaze Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22145v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A considerable part of the performance of today's large language models (LLM's) and multimodal large language models (MLLM's) depends on their tokenization strategies. While tokenizers are extensively researched for textual and visual input, there is no research on tokenization strategies for gaze data due to its nature. However, a corresponding tokenization strategy would allow using the vision capabilities of pre-trained MLLM's for gaze data, for example, through fine-tuning. In this paper, we aim to close this research gap by analyzing five different tokenizers for gaze data on three different datasets for the forecasting and generation of gaze data through LLMs (cf.~\cref{fig:teaser}). We evaluate the tokenizers regarding their reconstruction and compression abilities. Further, we train an LLM for each tokenization strategy, measuring its generative and predictive performance. Overall, we found that a quantile tokenizer outperforms all others in predicting the gaze positions and k-means is best when predicting gaze velocities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single Image Unlearning: Efficient Machine Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12523v3)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal Large Language Models See Like Humans?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09603v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, leveraging recent advancements in large language models. However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. Diverse human participants attained strong performance, significantly outperforming MLLMs, which further underscores the benchmark's high quality. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiaying.link/HVSBench/</p></details> |
| **[Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o. All codes, models, data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/Video-R1</p></details> |
| **[OmniBench: Towards The Future of Universal Omni-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15272v4)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have focused on integrating multiple modalities, yet their ability to simultaneously process and reason across different inputs remains underexplored. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define language models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench features high-quality human annotations that require integrated understanding across all modalities. Our evaluation reveals that: i) open-source OLMs show significant limitations in instruction-following and reasoning in tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baseline models perform poorly (around 50% accuracy) even with textual alternatives to image/audio inputs. To address these limitations, we develop OmniInstruct, an 96K-sample instruction tuning dataset for training OLMs. We advocate for developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance. Codes and data could be found at our repo (https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/OmniBench).</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-R1: Enhancing Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21620v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks. To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaceBench: A Multi-View Multi-Level Facial Attribute VQA Dataset for Benchmarking Face Perception MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21457v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. However, effectively evaluating these MLLMs on face perception remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FaceBench, a dataset featuring hierarchical multi-view and multi-level attributes specifically designed to assess the comprehensive face perception abilities of MLLMs. Initially, we construct a hierarchical facial attribute structure, which encompasses five views with up to three levels of attributes, totaling over 210 attributes and 700 attribute values. Based on the structure, the proposed FaceBench consists of 49,919 visual question-answering (VQA) pairs for evaluation and 23,841 pairs for fine-tuning. Moreover, we further develop a robust face perception MLLM baseline, Face-LLaVA, by training with our proposed face VQA data. Extensive experiments on various mainstream MLLMs and Face-LLaVA are conducted to test their face perception ability, with results also compared against human performance. The results reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding the fine-grained facial attributes, while our Face-LLaVA significantly outperforms existing open-source models with a small amount of training data and is comparable to commercial ones like GPT-4o and Gemini. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/FaceBench.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Video-3D LLM: Learning Position-Aware Video Representation for 3D Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00493v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly impacted various multimodal tasks. However, these models face challenges in tasks that require spatial understanding within 3D environments. Efforts to enhance MLLMs, such as incorporating point cloud features, have been made, yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data, which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel generalist model, i.e., Video-3D LLM, for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations, our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. In addition, we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[What Do You See? Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v4)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVL-X: Advancing and Accelerating InternVL Series with Efficient Visual Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21307v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) treat visual tokens as "a sequence of text", integrating them with text tokens into a large language model (LLM). However, a great quantity of visual tokens significantly increases the demand for computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose InternVL-X, which outperforms the InternVL model in both performance and efficiency by incorporating three visual token compression methods. First, we propose a novel vision-language projector, PVTC. This component integrates adjacent visual embeddings to form a local query and utilizes the transformed CLS token as a global query, then performs point-to-region cross-attention through these local and global queries to more effectively convert visual features. Second, we present a layer-wise visual token compression module, LVTC, which compresses tokens in the LLM shallow layers and then expands them through upsampling and residual connections in the deeper layers. This significantly enhances the model computational efficiency. Futhermore, we propose an efficient high resolution slicing method, RVTC, which dynamically adjusts the number of visual tokens based on image area or length filtering. RVTC greatly enhances training efficiency with only a slight reduction in performance. By utilizing 20% or fewer visual tokens, InternVL-X achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 public MLLM benchmarks, and improves the average metric by 2.34% across 12 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |

Despite the development of numerous automatic methods for detecting anomalies, human oversight remains necessary to review and act upon detected anomalies, as well as verify their accuracy. We study the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to partially automate this process. We find that LLMs can effectively identify false alarms by integrating visual inspection of time series plots with text descriptions of the data-generating process. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, we aim to reduce the reliance on human effort required to maintain a TSAD system</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main content: 4 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

Building on this foundation, we introduce ScreenLLM, a set of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) tailored for advanced UI understanding and action prediction. Extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models show that ScreenLLM accurately models user behavior and predicts actions. Our work lays the foundation for scalable, robust, and intelligent GUI agents that enhance user interaction in diverse software environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MM4SG Workshop at The Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
