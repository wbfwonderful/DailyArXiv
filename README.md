| **[FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11254v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Adaptive Multi-Stage Video Anomaly Reasoning: A Benchmark Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10165v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aligned Captions for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08155v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for safety-critical applications, yet even with recent progress, much of the research still lacks spatial grounding, making the explanations unverifiable. This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrismVAU: Prompt-Refined Inference System for Multimodal Video Anomaly Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02927v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 6th Workshop on Real-World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges (WACV 2026)</p></details> |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[RefineVAD: Semantic-Guided Feature Recalibration for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13204v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Coherence for Configurable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07328v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) relies on technologies in the field of signal processing. Since the anomaly is quite ambiguous and unbounded, different detection demands may often be raised even in one scenario. Thus, we propose to design the configurable VAD with flexible solutions targeting to solve the issue that previous methods have to train their models from scratch and waste resources when detection demands even change slightly. Moreover, we also design a dataset with good compatibility to evaluate the VAD performance when changes happen in detection demands. Besides, videos contain important information regarding continuous changes in the object's appearance and motion. Thus, we also propose a module to establish the multi-scale spatial-temporal coherence, which improves the accuracy and has the ability to dynamically adjust and accurately capture spatial-temporal normal patterns. Experiments show that our method not only models coherence effectively but also has better configurable ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeadHunt-VAD: Hunting Robust Anomaly-Sensitive Heads in MLLM for Tuning-Free Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17601v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo Anomalies Are All You Need: Diffusion-Based Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06845v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying video anomaly detection in practice is hampered by the scarcity and collection cost of real abnormal footage. We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CADE: Continual Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06840v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has long been studied as a crucial problem in public security and crime prevention. In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the "incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v4)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Semantics-Aware Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods face two critical challenges: (1) Strong generalization blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal patterns. Although existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue using memory modules, their rigid prototype-matching process limits adaptability to diverse scenarios; (2) Relying solely on low-level appearance and motion cues makes it difficult to perceive high-level semantic anomalies in complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose SIB-VAD, a novel framework based on adaptive information bottleneck filtering and semantic-aware enhancement. We propose the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) to replace traditional memory modules. It compresses normal features directly into a low-dimensional manifold based on the information bottleneck principle and uses an adaptive routing mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable normal bottleneck subspace. Trained only on normal data, SFFMs only learn normal low-dimensional manifolds, while abnormal features deviate and are effectively filtered. Unlike memory modules, SFFM directly removes abnormal information and adaptively handles scene variations. To improve semantic awareness, we further design a multimodal prediction framework that jointly models appearance, motion, and semantics. Through multimodal consistency constraints and joint error computation, it achieves more robust VAD performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our feature filtering paradigm based on semantics-aware information bottleneck.

| **[Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Sparse Reasoning is Enough: Biological-Inspired Framework for Video Anomaly Detection with Large Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17094v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Time in Static Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12321v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

| **[Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |

Mitigating Object-Driven Shortcuts in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16211v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/KHU-VLL/RCORE</p></details> |
| **[PyraTok: Language-Aligned Pyramidal Tokenizer for Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16210v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPro: Adaptive Program Reasoning for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17743v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoThinker: Building Agentic VideoLLMs with LLM-Guided Tool Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15724v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Main Track |

However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RiskCueBench: Benchmarking Anticipatory Reasoning from Early Risk Cues in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03369v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>*upda...</summary><p>*updated author email in this version</p></details> |

Lately, transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism capabilities, have proved their efficiency in many applications. In this study, we introduce a new two-stream transformer video classifier, which extracts spatio-temporal information from content and optical flow representing movement information. The proposed model identifies self-attention features across the joint optical flow and temporal frame domain and represents their relationships within the transformer encoder mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed methodology provides excellent classification results on three well-known video datasets of human activities.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEC: A Reference-Free Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage Metric for Evaluating Sampled Video Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13974v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frame sampling is a fundamental component in video understanding and video--language model pipelines, yet evaluating the quality of sampled frames remains challenging. Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content. We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality. Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding. We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper corresponds to the camera-ready version of a WACV 2026 Workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Long Video Understanding with Audiovisual Entity Cohesion and Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13719v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding presents significant challenges for vision-language models due to extremely long context windows. Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured, multimodal reasoning for comprehensive and context-consistent understanding of long-form videos.</p></details> |  |

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers critical improvements over existing STG datasets. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced duration and query distribution. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro Preview and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks. The latest Vidi2.5 offers significantly stronger STG capability and slightly better TR and Video QA performance over Vidi2. This update also introduces a Vidi2.5-Think model to handle plot understanding with complex plot reasoning. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of plot understanding, we propose VUE-PLOT benchmark with two tracks, Character and Reasoning. Notably, Vidi2.5-Think outperforms Gemini 3 Pro Preview on fine-grained character understanding with comparable performance on complex plot reasoning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Vidi2.5 on a challenging real-world application, video editing planning.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

However, the reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex video-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SILVR, a Simple Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SILVR transforms raw video into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex video-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs, we use an Adaptive Context Reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the temporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and training-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on Video-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife. Furthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows that, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can effectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition reasoning tasks in video.

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |

However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural</p></details> |  |

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |

Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption).

However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |

Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

The resulting single-checkpoint vision-language models expose reading, detection, and grounding through a unified, prompt-based interface. Trained on business documents, scientific articles, and synthetic grounding data, the models support full-page and localized reading with line- and paragraph-level bounding boxes and conditional ``where is x?'' queries. We introduce a grounded OCR evaluation protocol and show that GutenOCR-7B more than doubles the composite grounded OCR score of its Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone on 10.5K held-out business and scientific pages (0.40 to 0.82). On Fox and OmniDocBench v1.5, our approach substantially improves region- and line-level OCR as well as text-detection recall, but reveals trade-offs in page-level linearization, color-guided OCR, and formula-heavy layouts.</p></details> |  |

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.</p></details> |  |

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

While vision-language models have been applied to this problem, existing approaches directly map observations to grasp parameters without intermediate reasoning about physical interactions. We present DextER, Dexterous Grasp Generation with Embodied Reasoning, which introduces contact-based embodied reasoning for multi-finger manipulation. Our key insight is that predicting which hand links contact where on the object surface provides an embodiment-aware intermediate representation bridging task semantics with physical constraints. DextER autoregressively generates embodied contact tokens specifying which finger links contact where on the object surface, followed by grasp tokens encoding the hand configuration. On DexGYS, DextER achieves 67.14% success rate, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.83%p with 96.4% improvement in intention alignment. We also demonstrate steerable generation through partial contact specification, providing fine-grained control over grasp synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Models Align with Human Neural Representations in Concept Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17914v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest that transformer-based vision-language models (VLMs) capture the multimodality of concept processing in the human brain. However, a systematic evaluation exploring different types of VLM architectures and the role played by visual and textual context is still lacking. Here, we analyse multiple VLMs employing different strategies to integrate visual and textual modalities, along with language-only counterparts. We measure the alignment between concept representations by models and existing (fMRI) brain responses to concept words presented in two experimental conditions, where either visual (pictures) or textual (sentences) context is provided. Our results reveal that VLMs outperform the language-only counterparts in both experimental conditions. However, controlled ablation studies show that only for some VLMs, such as LXMERT and IDEFICS2, brain alignment stems from genuinely learning more human-like concepts during pretraining, while others are highly sensitive to the context provided at inference. Additionally, we find that vision-language encoders are more brain-aligned than more recent, generative VLMs. Altogether, our study shows that VLMs align with human neural representations in concept processing, while highlighting differences among architectures. We open-source code and materials to reproduce our experiments at: https://github.com/dmg-illc/vl-concept-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026 main</p></details> |

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: NeurIPS 2025 (main)</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Render-of-Thought: Rendering Textual Chain-of-Thought as Images for Visual Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14750v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT</p></details> |  |

Existing automatic analog circuit sizing approaches rely solely on netlists, ignoring the circuit schematic, which hinders the cognitive link between the schematic and its performance. Furthermore, the black-box nature of machine learning methods and hallucination risks in large language models fail to provide the necessary ground-truth explainability required for industrial sign-off. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision Language Model-optimized collaborative agent design workflow (VLM-CAD), which analyzes circuits, optimizes DC operating points, performs inference-based sizing, and executes external sizing optimization. We integrate Image2Net to annotate circuit schematics and generate a structured JSON description for precise interpretation by Vision Language Models. Furthermore, we propose an Explainable Trust Region Bayesian Optimization method (ExTuRBO) that employs collaborative warm-start from agent-generated seeds and offers dual-granularity sensitivity analysis for external sizing optimization, supporting a comprehensive final design report. Experiment results on amplifier sizing tasks using 180nm, 90nm, and 45nm Predictive Technology Models demonstrate that VLM-CAD effectively balances power and performance while maintaining physics-based explainability. VLM-CAD meets all specification requirements while maintaining low power consumption in optimizing an amplifier with a complementary input and a class-AB output stage, with a total runtime under 66 minutes across all experiments on two amplifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to the 10th International Conference on Control, Automation and Diagnosis (ICCAD'26)</p></details> |

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency. We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Situational and Spatial Awareness of VLMs with Synthetically Generated Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15780v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01747v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</p></details> | EACL |

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

Despite the impressive capabilities demonstrated by large vision language models (LVLMs) in understanding natural language, their susceptibility to generating plausible yet inaccurate claims, known as ``hallucinations'', raises concerns-especially in the nuanced and critical field of medical. In this work, we introduce a framework, \textbf{K}nowledge-\textbf{E}nhanced with Fine-Grained \textbf{R}einforced Rewards \textbf{M}edical Report Generation (KERM), to tackle the issue. Our approach refines the input to the LVLM by first utilizing MedCLIP for knowledge retrieval, incorporating relevant lesion fact sentences from a curated knowledge corpus. We then introduce a novel purification module to ensure the retrieved knowledge is contextually relevant to the patient's clinical context. Subsequently, we employ fine-grained rewards to guide these models in generating highly supportive and clinically relevant descriptions, ensuring the alignment of model's outputs with desired behaviors. Experimental results on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing report quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Product Attribute Labeling with Vision-Language Models: A Three-Tier Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15711v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026 Workshop on Physical Retail AI (PRAW)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11551v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-Text Retrieval (VTR) is a crucial multi-modal task in an era of massive video-text data on the Internet. A plethora of work characterized by using a two-stream Vision-Language model architecture that learns a joint representation of video-text pairs has become a prominent approach for the VTR task. However, these models operate under the assumption of bijective video-text correspondences and neglect a more practical scenario where video content usually encompasses multiple events, while texts like user queries or webpage metadata tend to be specific and correspond to single events. This establishes a gap between the previous training objective and real-world applications, leading to the potential performance degradation of earlier models during inference. In this study, we introduce the Multi-event Video-Text Retrieval (MeVTR) task, addressing scenarios in which each video contains multiple different events, as a niche scenario of the conventional Video-Text Retrieval Task. We present a simple model, Me-Retriever, which incorporates key event video representation and a new MeVTR loss for the MeVTR task. Comprehensive experiments show that this straightforward framework outperforms other models in the Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks, effectively establishing a robust baseline for the MeVTR task. We believe this work serves as a strong foundation for future studies.

Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\% to 17.29\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs.

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.</p></details> | 8 pages |

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\% to about 1\%.</p></details> | Under review |

By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also create Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 57,665 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art MLLMs, rule-based systems, and image-axis classifiers. Our results reveal that the task remains highly challenging.

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.</p></details> |  |

While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.</p></details> |  |

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios.

| **[VIOLA: Towards Video In-Context Learning with Minimal Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15549v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Heterogeneous Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15406v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[QKVQA: Question-Focused Filtering for Knowledge-based VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13856v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer questions by integrating images with external knowledge. Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/leaffeall/QKVQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperphantasia: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Mental Visualization Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11932v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each puzzle is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSNA Large Language Model Benchmark Dataset for Chest Radiographs of Cardiothoracic Disease: Radiologist Evaluation and Validation Enhanced by AI Labels (REVEAL-CXR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15129v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models have demonstrated comparable performance to that of radiology trainees on multiple-choice board-style exams. However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiViBench: An Omnimodal Benchmark for Interactive Livestream Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15016v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has advanced general video understanding. However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Main Track |
| **[Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Naturally Mitigates Forgetting in Continual Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05386v5)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[AStar: Boosting Multimodal Reasoning with Automated Structured Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02339v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models excel across diverse domains but struggle with complex visual reasoning tasks. To enhance their reasoning capabilities, current approaches typically rely on explicit search or post-training techniques. However, search-based methods suffer from computational inefficiency due to extensive solution space exploration, while post-training methods demand substantial data, computational resources, and often exhibit training instability. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AStar}, a training-free, \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{t}hinking paradigm for multimod\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}easoning. Specifically, we introduce novel ``thought cards'', a lightweight library of high-level reasoning patterns abstracted from prior samples. For each test problem, AStar adaptively retrieves the optimal thought cards and seamlessly integrates these external explicit guidelines with the model's internal implicit reasoning capabilities. Compared to previous methods, AStar eliminates computationally expensive explicit search and avoids additional complex post-training processes, enabling a more efficient reasoning approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves 53.9\% accuracy on MathVerse (surpassing GPT-4o's 50.2\%) and 32.7\% on MathVision (outperforming GPT-4o's 30.4\%). Further analysis reveals the remarkable transferability of our method: thought cards generated from mathematical reasoning can also be applied to other reasoning tasks, even benefiting general visual perception and understanding. AStar serves as a plug-and-play test-time inference method, compatible with other post-training techniques, providing an important complement to existing multimodal reasoning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Towards Aligning Multimodal LLMs with Human Experts: A Focus on Parent-Child Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04366v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in human-centred AI systems, their ability to understand complex social interactions remains uncertain. We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.05879</p></details> |
| **[Q-Probe: Scaling Image Quality Assessment to High Resolution via Context-Aware Agentic Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15356v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to achieve superior human preference alignment in Image Quality Assessment (IQA). However, existing RL-based IQA models typically rely on coarse-grained global views, failing to capture subtle local degradations in high-resolution scenarios. While emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigms enable multi-scale visual perception via zoom-in mechanisms, their direct adaptation to IQA induces spurious "cropping-implies-degradation" biases and misinterprets natural depth-of-field as artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Probe, the first agentic IQA framework designed to scale IQA to high resolution via context-aware probing. First, we construct Vista-Bench, a pioneering benchmark tailored for fine-grained local degradation analysis in high-resolution IQA settings. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns the model with human preferences, while simultaneously eliminating causal bias through a novel context-aware cropping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Probe achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution settings while maintaining superior efficacy across resolution scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[KBE-DME: Dynamic Multimodal Evaluation via Knowledge Enhanced Benchmark Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21182v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[HERMES: KV Cache as Hierarchical Memory for Efficient Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14724v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant improvement in offline video understanding. However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p></details> |  |
