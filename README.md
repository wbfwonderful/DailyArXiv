| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $Ï€$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> |  |

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. We present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel Bogdoll and Jan Imhof contributed equally.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v6)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional performance in video anomaly detection (VAD). However, most systems remain black boxes, lacking explainability during training and inference. A key challenge is integrating explicit knowledge into implicit models to create expert-driven, interpretable VAD systems. This paper introduces Rule-based Violence Monitoring (RuleVM), a novel weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD) paradigm. RuleVM employs a dual-branch architecture: an implicit branch using visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, with feature extraction split into scene frames and action channels, and an explicit branch leveraging language-image alignment for fine-grained classification. The explicit branch utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for object detection in video frames, with association rules mined from data as video descriptors. This design enables interpretable coarse- and fine-grained violence monitoring. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show RuleVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both granularities. Notably, it reveals rules like increased violence risk with crowd size.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work.

| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Contours -- A Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19588v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection prior art is rooted on the assumption that abnormal events can be mostly regarded as a result of uncommon human behavior. Opposed to utilizing skeleton representations of humans, however, we investigate the potential of learning recurrent motion patterns of normal human behavior using 2D contours. Keeping all advantages of pose-based methods, such as increased object anonymization, the shift from human skeletons to contours is hypothesized to leave the opportunity to cover more object categories open for future research. We propose formulating the problem as a regression and a classification task, and additionally explore two distinct data representation techniques for contours. To further reduce the computational complexity of Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection solutions, all methods in this study are based on shallow Neural Networks from the field of Deep Learning, and evaluated on the three most prominent benchmark datasets within Video Anomaly Detection and their human-related counterparts, totaling six datasets. Our results indicate that this novel perspective on Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection marks a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18808v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Anomize: Better Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18094v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14329v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify human behaviors that deviate from normal. At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/HuVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

| **[Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18079v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset. Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided, yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Fact-R1: Towards Explainable Video Misinformation Detection with Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16836v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |

Inspired by the success of large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results, which achieves impressive performance improvements.

Traditional approaches rely on isolated data streams, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the full context of a match. To address this, we introduce SoccerChat, a multimodal conversational AI framework that integrates visual and textual data for enhanced soccer video comprehension. Leveraging the extensive SoccerNet dataset, enriched with jersey color annotations and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, SoccerChat is fine-tuned on a structured video instruction dataset to facilitate accurate game understanding, event classification, and referee decision making. We benchmark SoccerChat on action classification and referee decision-making tasks, demonstrating its performance in general soccer event comprehension while maintaining competitive accuracy in referee decision making. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal integration in advancing soccer analytics, paving the way for more interactive and explainable AI-driven sports analysis. https://github.com/simula/SoccerChat</p></details> |  |

However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Well Can General Vision-Language Models Learn Medicine By Watching Public Educational Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14391v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available biomedical videos, such as those on YouTube, serve as valuable educational resources for medical students. Unlike standard machine learning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing medical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing. In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on image tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their respective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video evaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks, MIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves gains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%, respectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform biomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than those seen during training. These results suggest that educational videos created for human learning offer a surprisingly effective training signal for biomedical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA) that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability across multiple video domains.

| **[Clapper: Compact Learning and Video Representation in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15529v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e. capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method, we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61 tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available on the homepage.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViaRL: Adaptive Temporal Grounding via Visual Iterated Amplification Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15447v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01805v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video spatial reasoning, which involves inferring the underlying spatial structure from observed video frames, poses a significant challenge for existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This limitation stems primarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2) the lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning capabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims to improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this end, we introduce the $\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present $\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial reasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining general multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\textbf{Spatially-Guided RLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism, which encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process, thereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while maintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g., Video-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench). Remarkably, SpaceR surpasses the advanced GPT-4o by 11.6\% accuracy on VSI-Bench and is on par with the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.0-Flash, highlighting the effectiveness of our SpaceR-151k dataset and SG-RLVR in reinforcing spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs. Code, model, and dataset are available at https://github.com/OuyangKun10/SpaceR.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiveVLM: Efficient Online Video Understanding via Streaming-Oriented KV Cache and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15269v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have enabled models to process long video sequences and demonstrate remarkable performance. Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering, neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed, LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$ number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames, while maintaining the same or better model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Multimodal Graph-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15192v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.</p></details> |  |

Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/johncaged/VRoPE.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of progress in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/VideoEval-Pro, Project Webpage: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoEval-Pro</p></details> |

Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames, effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only 25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame Compression Adjustment strategy is compatible with other token compression methods to further improve their performance.

| **[Breaking Down Video LLM Benchmarks: Knowledge, Spatial Perception, or True Temporal Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14321v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research, we have open-sourced all model weights and training recipes at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main/InternLM-XComposer-2.5-Reward</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLAMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at "mixed precision" through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLAMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLAMP's superior performance across five video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLAMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

However, existing benchmarks are either severely limited in terms of video length and task diversity, or they focus solely on the end-to-end LVU performance, making them inappropriate for evaluating whether key moments can be accurately accessed. To address this challenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment retrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created based on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and collected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports. Second, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels: global-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action recognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it incorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries, image-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of MomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based approaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging video retrievers). Our results reveal the significant challenges in long-video moment retrieval in terms of accuracy and efficiency, despite improvements from the latest long-video MLLMs and task-specific fine-tuning. We have publicly released MomentSeeker(https://yhy-2000.github.io/MomentSeeker/) to facilitate future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 33 pages including supplementary</p></details> |

However, the use of RL beyond reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring (to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All), demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks (Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding, Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1 across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, existing datasets and models often fail to consider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of historical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this paper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current LVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-\textit{test}, even those that perform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a MedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and regional historical records. Our experiments show that integrating historical records significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy by at least 20\%, bridging the gap between current LVLMs and human expert performance. Additionally, we fine-tune models with MAG on MMXU-\textit{dev}, which demonstrates notable improvements. We hope this work could illuminate the avenue of advancing the use of LVLMs in medical diagnostics by emphasizing the importance of historical context in interpreting medical images. Our dataset is released at github: https://github.com/linjiemu/MMXU.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering, leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches.

While hard-prompt design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large {\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large {\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts, thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization, FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational complexity and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles, despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model, combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of foundation models in edge computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

Clinical imaging is inherently susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e., the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets. Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while preserving generalization across modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and Code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/RobustMedCLIP Accepted at: Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> |

Interpretable Vision-aware Latent Steering to Mitigate Object Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17812v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics, underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH benchmarks in future work.

Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeMVDrive: Multi-view Safety-Critical Driving Video Synthesis in the Real World Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17727v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

The recent research endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation. Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic attention complexity during the pre-filling phase remains a significant obstacle to real-world deployment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial locality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern. Simultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across different modalities. We introduce a permutation-based method to leverage the unique Grid pattern and handle modality boundary issues. By offline search the optimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse distribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates seamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or fine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA, Captioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art long-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while maintaining accuracy.

| **[Towards General Continuous Memory for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17670v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) and their extension, vision-language models (VLMs), have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require multimodal or multilingual real-world knowledge. To support such capabilities, an external memory system that can efficiently provide relevant multimodal information is essential. Existing approaches generally concatenate image and text tokens into a long sequence as memory, which, however, may drastically increase context length and even degrade performance. In contrast, we propose using continuous memory, a compact set of dense embeddings to more effectively and efficiently represent multimodal and multilingual knowledge. Our key insight is that a VLM can serve as its own continuous memory encoder. We empirically show that this design improves performance on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Building on this, we introduce a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method to fine-tune the VLM into a memory encoder, requiring only 1.2% of the model's parameters and a small corpus of 15.6K self-synthesized samples. Our approach CoMEM utilizes VLM's original capabilities to encode arbitrary multimodal and multilingual knowledge into just 8 continuous embeddings. Since the inference-time VLM remains frozen, our memory module is plug-and-play and can be flexibly integrated as needed. Extensive experiments across eight multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities: Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared, mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded human sensing accuracy by up to 30%.

This is especially critical in financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise, current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating in-table textual content and layout features.

However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained, task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | Under review |

However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators. However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process, enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://dongzhang89.github.io/RGenie.github.io/</p></details> |

In particular, vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output. However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural images.</p></details> |  |

We identify three key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data constrains the capabilities of foundation Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which imposes further limitations on the upper bounds of TTS and reinforcement learning (RL); (2) a lack of automated methods for process labeling within multimodal contexts persists; (3) the employment of process rewards in unimodal RL faces issues like reward hacking, which may extend to multimodal scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce URSA, a three-stage Unfolding multimodal Process-Supervision Aided training framework. We first construct MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality large-scale multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning dataset, to build a stronger math reasoning foundation MLLM, URSA-8B. Subsequently, we go through an automatic process to synthesize process supervision data, which emphasizes both logical correctness and perceptual consistency. We introduce DualMath-1.1M to facilitate the training of URSA-8B-RM. Finally, we propose Process-Supervised Group-Relative-Policy-Optimization (PS-GRPO), pioneering a multimodal PRM-aided online RL method that outperforms vanilla GRPO. With PS-GRPO application, URSA-8B-PS-GRPO outperforms Gemma3-12B and GPT-4o by 8.4% and 2.7% on average across 6 benchmarks.

Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |
| **[Co-Reinforcement Learning for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17534v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a pioneering exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) via group relative policy optimization for unified multimodal large language models (ULMs), aimed at simultaneously reinforcing generation and understanding capabilities. Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{CoRL}, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, \textbf{ULM-R1}, achieves average improvements of \textbf{7%} on three text-to-image generation datasets and \textbf{23%} on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correspondence of high-dimensional emotion structures elicited by video clips between humans and Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12746v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional, complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches, as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the single-item level.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[The Coherence Trap: When MLLM-Crafted Narratives Exploit Manipulated Visual Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17476v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations, yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations: Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning, to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden Ghost Hand: Unveiling Backdoor Vulnerabilities in MLLM-Powered Mobile GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14418v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design (conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase). Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end engineering. The FullFront benchmark and code are available in https://github.com/Mikivishy/FullFront.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chart-to-Experience: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs for Predicting Experiential Impact of Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17374v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising 36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE PacificVis 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Prompting with Iterative Refinement for Design Critique Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16829v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feedback is crucial for every design process, such as user interface (UI) design, and automating design critiques can significantly improve the efficiency of the design workflow. Although existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating high-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing detailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image. Building on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and visual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for UI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and generates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes that map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. The entire process is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text output and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step. We evaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human experts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over those by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human performance by 50% for one rating metric. To assess the generalizability of our approach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary object and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also outperformed the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScanBot: Towards Intelligent Surface Scanning in Embodied Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17295v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ScanBot, a novel dataset designed for instruction-conditioned, high-precision surface scanning in robotic systems. In contrast to existing robot learning datasets that focus on coarse tasks such as grasping, navigation, or dialogue, ScanBot targets the high-precision demands of industrial laser scanning, where sub-millimeter path continuity and parameter stability are critical. The dataset covers laser scanning trajectories executed by a robot across 12 diverse objects and 6 task types, including full-surface scans, geometry-focused regions, spatially referenced parts, functionally relevant structures, defect inspection, and comparative analysis. Each scan is guided by natural language instructions and paired with synchronized RGB, depth, and laser profiles, as well as robot pose and joint states. Despite recent progress, existing vision-language action (VLA) models still fail to generate stable scanning trajectories under fine-grained instructions and real-world precision demands. To investigate this limitation, we benchmark a range of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across the full perception-planning-execution loop, revealing persistent challenges in instruction-following under realistic constraints.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard) inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-, and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data. Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide future research in chart understanding domain.

| **[SophiaVL-R1: Reinforcing MLLMs Reasoning with Thinking Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17018v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have shown success in eliciting strong reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome rewards. However, this paradigm typically lacks supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result, the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time, allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU), demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite the latter having 10 times more parameters.
