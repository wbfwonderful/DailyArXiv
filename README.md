| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |
| **[SmartHome-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection in Smart Homes Using Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12992v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Xinyi-0724/SmartHome-Bench-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop: VAND 3.0 - Visual Anomaly and Novelty Detection</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MissionGNN: Hierarchical Multimodal GNN-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition with Mission-Specific Knowledge Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18815v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at https://github.com/EavnJeong/IEF-VAD.</p></details> |  |

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This highlights the need for reliable abnormality detectors that understand such principles and are robust to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark of over 3,000 video QA pairs built from synthetic videos generated by models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-crafted counterintuitive QA to evaluate the critical thinking abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on abnormalities that are perceptually obvious to humans but often hallucinated due to language priors. VideoHallu evaluates MLLMs' abnormality detection abilities with examples across alignment, consistency, commonsense, and physics. We benchmark SOTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen2.5-VL, Video-R1, and VideoChat-R1. We observe that these models perform well on many real-world benchmarks like MVBench and MovieChat, but still struggle with basic physics-based and commonsense reasoning in synthetic videos. We further show that post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), using curriculum learning on datasets combining video QA with counterintuitive commonsense and physics reasoning over real and synthetic videos, improves MLLMs' abnormality detection and critical thinking, demonstrating the value of targeted training for improving their understanding of commonsense and physical laws. Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Video Understanding with 16 Frames Per Second](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13956v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is dynamic and continuous. However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining.

| **[video-SALMONN 2: Captioning-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15220v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis.

| **[EVA02-AT: Egocentric Video-Language Understanding with Spatial-Temporal Rotary Positional Embeddings and Symmetric Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14356v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric video-language understanding demands both high efficiency and accurate spatial-temporal modeling. Existing approaches face three key challenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage pre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to manually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature interactions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance retrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we introduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models tailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently transfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a single-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional embeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode both spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This joint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn cross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and interaction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language retrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a novel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and negative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate that EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse egocentric video-language tasks with fewer parameters. Models with our SMS loss also show significant performance gains on multi-instance retrieval benchmarks. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/xqwang14/EVA02-AT .</p></details> |  |

Our design leverages a bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and comprehensive video understanding.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities.

| **[Unifying Specialized Visual Encoders for Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01426v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered sophisticated reasoning capabilities into the realm of video through Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). However, VideoLLMs currently rely on a single vision encoder for all of their visual processing, which limits the amount and type of visual information that can be conveyed to the LLM. Our method, MERV, Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos, instead leverages multiple frozen visual encoders to create a unified representation of a video, providing the VideoLLM with a comprehensive set of specialized visual knowledge. Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works. MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy than Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks, while also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA, the previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV introduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent single-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we provide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge from each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing multiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 as a Poster.

It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.</p></details> |  |

Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language and multimodal tasks, this survey provides a detailed overview of recent advancements in video understanding that harness the power of LLMs (Vid-LLMs). The emergent capabilities of Vid-LLMs are surprisingly advanced, particularly their ability for open-ended multi-granularity (general, temporal, and spatiotemporal) reasoning combined with commonsense knowledge, suggesting a promising path for future video understanding. We examine the unique characteristics and capabilities of Vid-LLMs, categorizing the approaches into three main types: Video Analyzer x LLM, Video Embedder x LLM, and (Analyzer + Embedder) x LLM. Furthermore, we identify five sub-types based on the functions of LLMs in Vid-LLMs: LLM as Summarizer, LLM as Manager, LLM as Text Decoder, LLM as Regressor, and LLM as Hidden Layer. Furthermore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for Vid-LLMs. Additionally, it explores the expansive applications of Vid-LLMs across various domains, highlighting their remarkable scalability and versatility in real-world video understanding challenges.

As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich scenarios. To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), while utilizing fewer resources and less input data. The results demonstrate Multi- RAG's potential as a practical and efficient foundation for future human-robot adaptive assistance systems in dynamic, real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoQA in the Era of LLMs: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04223v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However, models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.</p></details> | IJCV'25 |

However, trustworthiness challenges factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks, undermine reliability due to video data's spatiotemporal complexities. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating videoLLMs across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses dynamic visual scenarios, cross-modal interactions, and real-world safety concerns. Our evaluation of 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming scale effects. These findings highlight the need for advanced safety alignment to enhance capabilities. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolbox for standardized trustworthiness assessments, bridging the gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and critical demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.</p></details> |  |

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial tampering and manipulations remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MVTamperBench}, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping; based on real-world visual tampering scenarios such as surveillance interference, social media content edits, and misinformation injection. MVTamperBench comprises ~3.4K original videos, expanded into over ~17K tampered clips covering 19 distinct video manipulation tasks. This benchmark challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families. We reveal substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and show that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms. We release all code, data, and benchmark to foster open research in trustworthy video understanding.

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption.

In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person.

However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://byungkwanlee.github.io/GenRecal-page/</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Stage Value-Guided Inference with Margin-Based Reward Adjustment for Fast and Faithful VLM Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15649v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset and code will be made available at: https://findingdory-benchmark.github.io/</p></details> |

Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then, we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection. Finally, we explore the advancements in the emerging Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) era, such as GPT-4V. We conclude with open challenges and future directions.

| **[Vision Transformers Don't Need Trained Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08010v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code: https://avdravid.github.io/test-time-registers</p></details> |
| **[WikiMixQA: A Multimodal Benchmark for Question Answering over Tables and Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15594v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |
| **[DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

| **[LaViDa: A Large Diffusion Language Model for Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16839v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Context-Informed Grounding Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15480v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefChartQA: Grounding Visual Answer on Chart Images through Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23131v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have increasingly emphasized document visual grounding to achieve better human-computer interaction, accessibility, and detailed understanding. However, its application to visualizations such as charts remains under-explored due to the inherent complexity of interleaved visual-numerical relationships in chart images. Existing chart understanding methods primarily focus on answering questions without explicitly identifying the visual elements that support their predictions. To bridge this gap, we introduce RefChartQA, a novel benchmark that integrates Chart Question Answering (ChartQA) with visual grounding, enabling models to refer elements at multiple granularities within chart images. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation by instruction-tuning 5 state-of-the-art VLMs across different categories. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating spatial awareness via grounding improves response accuracy by over 15%, reducing hallucinations, and improving model reliability. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing text-spatial alignment, such as architectural improvements in TinyChart, which leverages a token-merging module for enhanced feature fusion. Our dataset is open-sourced for community development and further advancements. All models and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/moured/RefChartQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDAR 2025.

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations at www.bliss.berlin/research/scam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop EVAL-FoMo-2</p></details> |
| **[OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15318v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard.

| **[Jailbreak Large Vision-Language Models Through Multi-Modal Linkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00473v5)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the significant advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), concerns about their potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/wangyu-ovo/MML.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReSeDis: A Dataset for Referring-based Object Search across Large-Scale Image Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15180v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-VLDoc: Bidirectional Vision-Language Modeling for Visually-Rich Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13155v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal document pre-trained models have proven to be very effective in a variety of visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) tasks. Though existing document pre-trained models have achieved excellent performance on standard benchmarks for VrDU, the way they model and exploit the interactions between vision and language on documents has hindered them from better generalization ability and higher accuracy. In this work, we investigate the problem of vision-language joint representation learning for VrDU mainly from the perspective of supervisory signals. Specifically, a pre-training paradigm called Bi-VLDoc is proposed, in which a bidirectional vision-language supervision strategy and a vision-language hybrid-attention mechanism are devised to fully explore and utilize the interactions between these two modalities, to learn stronger cross-modal document representations with richer semantics. Benefiting from the learned informative cross-modal document representations, Bi-VLDoc significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used document understanding benchmarks, including Form Understanding (from 85.14% to 93.44%), Receipt Information Extraction (from 96.01% to 97.84%), and Document Classification (from 96.08% to 97.12%). On Document Visual QA, Bi-VLDoc achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single model methods.</p></details> | IJDAR 2025 |

In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot, bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE</p></details> |
| **[SemVink: Advancing VLMs' Semantic Understanding of Optical Illusions via Visual Global Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02803v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

EgoBlind comprises 1,392 videos that record the daily lives of real blind users from a first-person perspective. It also features 5,311 questions directly posed or generated and verified by blind individuals to reflect their in-situation needs for visual assistance under various scenarios. We provide each question with an average of 3 reference answers to alleviate subjective evaluation. Using EgoBlind, we comprehensively evaluate 16 advanced MLLMs and find that all models struggle, with the best performers achieving accuracy near 60\%, far behind human performance of 87.4\%. To guide future advancements, we identify and summarize major limitations of existing MLLMs in egocentric visual assistance for the blind and explore heuristic solutions for improvement. With these efforts, we hope EgoBlind can serve as a valuable foundation for developing more effective AI assistants to enhance the independence of the blind individuals' lives.

Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism. Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine transformations derived from visual features. We propose two implementations: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted report generation. Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical report generation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding GUI Agent Localization Biases through Logit Sharpness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15425v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEGC2025: Micro-Expression Grand Challenge on Spot Then Recognize and Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15298v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard.

However, in video understanding with multimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of frame-per-second (FPS) $\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both general and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and TemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks, including high-speed sports analysis (\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football, gymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method for F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without requiring model retraining. We will release the source code, model checkpoints, and data at \href{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}{https://github.com/bytedance/F-16}.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaVideoRAG: Omni-Contextual Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Efficient Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13589v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis. Codes will be open-sourced at https://github.com/xzc-zju/AdaVideoRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Street Views to Urban Science: Discovering Road Safety Factors with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02242v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning, development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASCD: Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding for Reducing Hallucination in MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14766v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) often suffer from hallucinations. They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Exploring MLLMs Perception of Network Visualization Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14611v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we test whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can match human-subject performance in tasks involving the perception of properties in network layouts. Specifically, we replicate a human-subject experiment about perceiving quality (namely stress) in network layouts using GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5. Our experiments show that giving MLLMs exactly the same study information as trained human participants results in a similar performance to human experts and exceeds the performance of untrained non-experts. Additionally, we show that prompt engineering that deviates from the human-subject experiment can lead to better-than-human performance in some settings. Interestingly, like human subjects, the MLLMs seem to rely on visual proxies rather than computing the actual value of stress, indicating some sense or facsimile of perception. Explanations from the models provide descriptions similar to those used by the human participants (e.g., even distribution of nodes and uniform edge lengths).</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05243v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral).

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the camera-ready version for ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LingoLoop Attack: Trapping MLLMs via Linguistic Context and State Entrapment into Endless Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14493v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great promise but require substantial computational resources during inference. Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment. The code will be released publicly following the paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense360: Dense Understanding from Omnidirectional Panoramas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14471v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require comprehensive visual inputs to achieve dense understanding of the physical world. While existing MLLMs demonstrate impressive world understanding capabilities through limited field-of-view (FOV) visual inputs (e.g., 70 degree), we take the first step toward dense understanding from omnidirectional panoramas. We first introduce an omnidirectional panoramas dataset featuring a comprehensive suite of reliability-scored annotations. Specifically, our dataset contains 160K panoramas with 5M dense entity-level captions, 1M unique referring expressions, and 100K entity-grounded panoramic scene descriptions. Compared to multi-view alternatives, panoramas can provide more complete, compact, and continuous scene representations through equirectangular projections (ERP). However, the use of ERP introduces two key challenges for MLLMs: i) spatial continuity along the circle of latitude, and ii) latitude-dependent variation in information density. We address these challenges through ERP-RoPE, a position encoding scheme specifically designed for panoramic ERP. In addition, we introduce Dense360-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on omnidirectional captioning and grounding, establishing a comprehensive framework for advancing dense visual-language understanding in panoramic settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to represent multimodal information in the acoustic domain remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vela, a novel framework designed to adapt MLLMs for the generation of universal multimodal embeddings. By leveraging MLLMs with specially crafted prompts and selected in-context learning examples, Vela effectively bridges the modality gap across various modalities. We then propose a single-modality training approach, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. Our experiments show that Vela outperforms traditional CLAP models in standard text-audio retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce new benchmarks that expose CLAP models' limitations in handling long texts and complex retrieval tasks. In contrast, Vela, by harnessing the capabilities of MLLMs, demonstrates robust performance in these scenarios. Our code will soon be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modality-Aware Neuron Pruning for Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15910v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive datasets can lead them to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information, raising ethical and privacy concerns. While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[From Black Boxes to Transparent Minds: Evaluating and Enhancing the Theory of Mind in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14224v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models evolve, there is growing anticipation that they will emulate human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) to assist with routine tasks. However, existing methods for evaluating machine ToM focus primarily on unimodal models and largely treat these models as black boxes, lacking an interpretative exploration of their internal mechanisms. In response, this study adopts an approach based on internal mechanisms to provide an interpretability-driven assessment of ToM in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we first construct a multimodal ToM test dataset, GridToM, which incorporates diverse belief testing tasks and perceptual information from multiple perspectives. Next, our analysis shows that attention heads in multimodal large models can distinguish cognitive information across perspectives, providing evidence of ToM capabilities. Furthermore, we present a lightweight, training-free approach that significantly enhances the model's exhibited ToM by adjusting in the direction of the attention head.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 22 figures, accepted at ICML 2025, project page: see https://annaisavailable.github.io/GridToM/</p></details> |
