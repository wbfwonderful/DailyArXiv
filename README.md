| **[Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e., automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at https://github.com/showlab/PANDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUAL-VAD: Dual Benchmarks and Anomaly-Focused Sampling for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11605v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety. However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task. Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages in IEEE double-column format, 1 figure, 5 tables.

| **[Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA-Crime: A Synthetic Dataset and Generation Framework for Fatal Violence Detection with Adversarial Snippet-Level Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08232v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset and the data generation framework are publicly available at https://github.com/ta-ho/GTA-Crime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight |
| **[A Survey on Video Anomaly Detection via Deep Learning: Human, Vehicle, and Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14203v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GV-VAD : Exploring Video Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00312v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DAMS:Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20629v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ACM MM 2025; Code: https://github.com/YihuaJerry/EventVAD</p></details> |

To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://enxinsong.com/VideoNSA-web/, Code: https://github.com/Espere-1119-Song/VideoNSA</p></details> |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

| **[EyePCR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Fine-Grained Perception, Knowledge Comprehension and Clinical Reasoning in Ophthalmic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15596v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1.

| **[StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01875v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective, training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty, enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We present UniVid, a unified architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |

This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.</p></details> | Underreview |

To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameThinker: Learning to Think with Long Videos via Multi-Turn Frame Spotlighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24304v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy. Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Culturally-diverse Multilingual Multimodal Video Benchmark & Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07032v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding. Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; 15 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism, which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate, inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning. As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning.

In this paper, we take a different approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.</p></details> |  |

Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPurify: A Data-Efficient Geometric Distillation Framework for Open-Vocabulary 3D Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02186v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> |
| **[Post-hoc Probabilistic Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06014v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aaltoml.github.io/BayesVLM/</p></details> |
| **[Robust Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models with Mild Semantic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning has shown promising results, but its robustness and generalization to unseen categories remain limited. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the complete removal of semantic noise is a key factor restricting robustness. Existing methods typically suppress or filter out semantic noise in the prompt space, inadvertently hindering the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen categories. To address this, we propose ANPrompt, a robust prompt tuning framework that actively incorporates weak semantic noise. By clustering weakly perturbed features into noise prompts and integrating them with learnable tokens in both the text and vision encoders, ANPrompt ensures controlled exposure to semantic variations. To enhance the visual pathway, we introduce the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP), which stabilizes visual semantics under weak perturbations. Additionally, we propose a Weak Alignment Loss (WALoss) at the logits level to enforce consistency between clean and perturbed predictions, providing stable supervision. By combining weak semantic noise exposure with logits-based consistency, ANPrompt prevents overfitting to specific phrasings while preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmarks, including base-to-new splits, show that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning methods, offering superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization across tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches largely focus on high-level tool grounding or quasi-static manipulation, overlooking stability in dynamic and cluttered regimes. We introduce iTuP (inverse Tool-use Planning), a framework that outputs robot grasps explicitly tailored for tool use. iTuP integrates a physics-constrained grasp generator with a task-conditional scoring function to produce grasps that remain stable during dynamic tool interactions. These grasps account for manipulation trajectories, torque requirements, and slip prevention, enabling reliable execution of real-world tasks. Experiments across hammering, sweeping, knocking, and reaching tasks demonstrate that iTuP outperforms geometry-based and vision-language model (VLM)-based baselines in grasp stability and task success. Our results underscore that physics-constrained grasping is essential for robust robot tool use in quasi-static, dynamic, and cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission and under review</p></details> |
| **[More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25848v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks.

Their applications in the software engineering of CPSs are also growing. However, research in this area remains limited. Moreover, existing studies have primarily focused on LLMs-only one type of FM-leaving ample opportunities to explore others, such as vision-language models. We argue that, in addition to LLMs, other FMs utilizing different data modalities (e.g., images, audio) and multimodal models (which integrate multiple modalities) hold great potential for supporting CPS software engineering, given that these systems process diverse data types. To address this, we present a research roadmap for integrating FMs into various phases of CPS software engineering, highlighting key research opportunities and challenges for the software engineering community. Moreover, we discuss the common challenges associated with applying FMs in this context, including the correctness of FM-generated artifacts, as well as the inherent uncertainty and hallucination associated with FMs. This roadmap is intended for researchers and practitioners in CPS software engineering, providing future research directions using FMs in this domain.</p></details> | 2 figures, 37 pages |

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

| **[Accelerating Attention with Basis Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01718v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity (PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing engineering-level optimizations.

| **[Contrastive Representation Regularization for Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01711v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown its capabilities in robot manipulation by leveraging rich representations from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, their representations arguably remain suboptimal, lacking sensitivity to robotic signals such as control actions and proprioceptive states. To address the issue, we introduce Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL), a simple and effective representation regularization for VLA models, designed to bridge the gap between VLM representations and robotic signals. In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17551v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</p></details> |  |

However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

| **[Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

Comparitive Analysis of CNNs and Biomedical Vision Language Modles in Medical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00411v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6page...</summary><p>6pages,3 figures.Uunder review of International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Computer, Data Sciences and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Source-Free Cross-Domain Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01649v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties, thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples with significant margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model as a Noise-Aware Latent Reward Model for Step-Level Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01051v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference optimization for diffusion models aims to align them with human preferences for images. Previous methods typically use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as pixel-level reward models to approximate human preferences. However, when used for step-level preference optimization, these models face challenges in handling noisy images of different timesteps and require complex transformations into pixel space. In this work, we show that pre-trained diffusion models are naturally suited for step-level reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process latent images at various noise levels. Accordingly, we propose the Latent Reward Model (LRM), which repurposes components of the diffusion model to predict preferences of latent images at arbitrary timesteps. Building on LRM, we introduce Latent Preference Optimization (LPO), a step-level preference optimization method conducted directly in the noisy latent space. Experimental results indicate that LPO significantly improves the model's alignment with general, aesthetic, and text-image alignment preferences, while achieving a 2.5-28x training speedup over existing preference optimization methods.

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | Preprint |

The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection, providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for presentation in TRB annual meeting 2026.

To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1.

However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models.

| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Multimodal Large Language Models with Blind and Low Vision People Visual Questions for Proactive Visual Interpretations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01576v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations. However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly available in a Github repository at https://github.com/rgonzalezp/guiding-multimodal-large-language-models-with-blind-and-low-vision-people-visual-questions .</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figure, 2 tables, CV4A11y Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Growing Visual Generative Capacity for Pre-Trained MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01546v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hywang66.github.io/bridge/</p></details> |
| **[Automatically Generating Web Applications from Requirements Via Multi-Agent Test-Driven Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25297v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive, demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation, including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality web applications without requiring manual intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRPO: Paragraph-level Policy Optimization for Vision-Language Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26272v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level. Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeEraser: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520v5)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective, training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty, enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BindWeave: Subject-Consistent Video Generation via Cross-Modal Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00438v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-and-Play Prompt Refinement via Latent Feedback for Diffusion Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00430v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory, thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement. Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Automated Structured Radiology Report Generation with Rich Clinical Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00428v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at https://github.com/vuno/contextualized-srrg.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 30 figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D environments remains a distinct challenge due to the complexity of spatial reasoning. Nevertheless, existing 3D benchmarks often lack fine-grained numerical reasoning task annotations, limiting MLLMs' ability to perform precise spatial measurements and complex numerical reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NUMINA, the first Natural Understanding benchmark for Multi-dimensional Intelligence and Numerical reasoning Abilities to enhance multimodal indoor perceptual understanding. NUMINA features multi-scale annotations and various question-answer pairs, generated using NUMINA-Flow, an automated annotation pipeline that integrates LLM rewriting and rule-based self-verification. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs on NUMINA following the Chat-Scene framework, demonstrating that current LLMs struggle with multimodal numerical reasoning, particularly in performing precise computations such as distance and volume estimation, highlighting the need for further advancements in 3D models. The dataset and source codes can be obtained from https://github.com/fengshun124/NUMINA.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAL-UI: Planning with Active Look-back for Vision-Based GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00413v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
