| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A newly identified systematic error in our data processing pipeline has affected the calculation and reporting of AUC metrics (notably in Tables [1, 2]). This significantly impacts our main experimental results and conclusions, compromising their reliability.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MissionGNN: Hierarchical Multimodal GNN-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition with Mission-Specific Knowledge Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18815v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. We present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel Bogdoll and Jan Imhof contributed equally.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Networking Systems for Video Anomaly Detection: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10347v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work.

| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[Bridging Perspectives: A Survey on Cross-view Collaborative Intelligence with Egocentric-Exocentric Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06253v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years, allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications. Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis, and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally, we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives, evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions. By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner.

| **[VideoChat-A1: Thinking with Long Videos by Chain-of-Shot Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06097v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.</p></details> |  |

We propose a systematic evaluation framework and evaluate several language-only and video large language models (video-LLMs) on this benchmark. We observe a performance gap in language-only and video-LLMs, especially on questions focusing on temporal ordering, thus identifying a research gap in the area of long-context video understanding.

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with 1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that on out-of-domain benchmarks, reasoning in the language space fails to bring performance gains.

To address these limitations, we introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories (e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds, enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We propose APVR (Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames. This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing MLLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology.

However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts.

However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work, we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance. It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves 65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.</p></details> |  |

Tackling this, recent methods have proposed to drop or merge tokens for image models, whether randomly or via learned methods. Merging tokens has many benefits: it can be plugged into any vision transformer, does not require model re-training, and it propagates information that would otherwise be dropped through the model. Before now, video token merging has not been evaluated on temporally complex datasets for video understanding. In this work, we explore training-free token merging for video to provide comprehensive experiments and find best practices across four video transformers on three datasets that exhibit coarse and fine-grained action recognition. Our results showcase the benefits of video token merging with a speedup of around $2.5$X while maintaining accuracy (avg. $-0.55\%$ for ViViT).

While prior works have explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for future research in interaction-centric video understanding.

Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |

To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines.

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications.

Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations, we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering, demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM architectures.

Many focus on peripheral, ``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length, open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs -- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs. These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.</p></details> | Under Review |

Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data.

In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in vision representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Notably, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this work, we present the first large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions: (1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3) How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context? Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key areas for improvement in medical visual language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenIR: Generative Visual Feedback for Mental Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06220v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind, that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> |
| **[GenSpace: Benchmarking Spatially-Aware Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24870v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar 3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[WisWheat: A Three-Tiered Vision-Language Dataset for Wheat Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06084v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield. Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology; (2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements. Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Full Conformal Adaptation of Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06076v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP, and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>IPMI ...</summary><p>IPMI 2025.

In contrast to existing action tokenizers based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck" without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2) multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and (3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.</p></details> | <details><summary>WOD V...</summary><p>WOD Vision-based End-to-End Driving Challenge</p></details> |

Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05318v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.</p></details> |  |

To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 main conference</p></details> |

Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Vision-Language Models Distinguish between the Actual and Apparent Features of Illusions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05765v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions. However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types, they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding.

While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p></details> |  |

However, these encoding methods lack the ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of recognizing and aligning with human moral values.</p></details> |  |

Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose Leopard, an MLLM tailored for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we proposed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of images. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks reveal that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, such as Llama-3.2 and Qwen2-VL, in challenging text-rich, multi-image evaluations. Remarkably, our approach achieves outstanding performance using only 1.2M training instances, all of which are fully open-sourced, demonstrating both high efficiency and effectiveness compared to models trained on large-scale in-house data.

However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues. (3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS, and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair) in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated front-end development.

Yet, a critical gap persists, `conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g., Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form. Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at: \href{https://vga.csail.mit.edu/}{vga.csail.mit.edu}</p></details> |  |

Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate'' algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon at https://github.com/finyorko/armor.</p></details> |  |

But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos, while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human. Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm. Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema, outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with 7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.</p></details> |  |

Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal, Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056 multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research on automated theorem proving.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving.

| **[CAPability: A Comprehensive Visual Caption Benchmark for Evaluating Both Correctness and Thoroughness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14914v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual captioning benchmarks have become outdated with the emergence of modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as the brief ground-truth sentences and traditional metrics fail to assess detailed captions effectively. While recent benchmarks attempt to address this by focusing on keyword extraction or object-centric evaluation, they remain limited to vague-view or object-view analyses and incomplete visual element coverage. In this paper, we introduce CAPability, a comprehensive multi-view benchmark for evaluating visual captioning across 12 dimensions spanning six critical views. We curate nearly 11K human-annotated images and videos with visual element annotations to evaluate the generated captions. CAPability stably assesses both the correctness and thoroughness of captions with \textit{precision} and \textit{hit} metrics. By converting annotations to QA pairs, we further introduce a heuristic metric, \textit{know but cannot tell} ($K\bar{T}$), indicating a significant performance gap between QA and caption capabilities. Our work provides a holistic analysis of MLLMs' captioning abilities, as we identify their strengths and weaknesses across various dimensions, guiding future research to enhance specific aspects of their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-AI Alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models with Speech-Language Pathologists in Parent-Child Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05879v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

| **[Modality-Fair Preference Optimization for Trustworthy MLLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15334v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, separate training of visual and textual encoders often results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead models to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the trustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to optimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation indicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically, these models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is heavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the model focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object referenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the modalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our findings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which comprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset in which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an image reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better aligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy to stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three trustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain trustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and larger models.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches commonly only rely on 2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is vital for robust progress in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Visual Text Processing: A Comprehensive Review and Unified Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21682v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual text is a crucial component in both document and scene images, conveying rich semantic information and attracting significant attention in the computer vision community. Beyond traditional tasks such as text detection and recognition, visual text processing has witnessed rapid advancements driven by the emergence of foundation models, including text image reconstruction and text image manipulation. Despite significant progress, challenges remain due to the unique properties that differentiate text from general objects. Effectively capturing and leveraging these distinct textual characteristics is essential for developing robust visual text processing models. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in visual text processing, focusing on two key questions: (1) What textual features are most suitable for different visual text processing tasks? (2) How can these distinctive text features be effectively incorporated into processing frameworks? Furthermore, we introduce VTPBench, a new benchmark that encompasses a broad range of visual text processing datasets. Leveraging the advanced visual quality assessment capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we propose VTPScore, a novel evaluation metric designed to ensure fair and reliable evaluation. Our empirical study with more than 20 specific models reveals substantial room for improvement in the current techniques. Our aim is to establish this work as a fundamental resource that fosters future exploration and innovation in the dynamic field of visual text processing.

| **[Is Cognition Consistent with Perception? Assessing and Mitigating Multimodal Knowledge Conflicts in Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07722v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant industrial demand. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models to possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, due to different types of annotation noise in training, current MLLMs often face conflicts between perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an example, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding visual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that the MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the information it "sees" and what it "understands". Such conflicts challenge the intuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the performance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts between cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&P) knowledge conflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflict, and systematically assess them with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even GPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 75.26% C&P consistency. To mitigate the C&P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge Consistency Fine-tuning. Our method reduces C&P knowledge conflicts across all tested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual tasks. All data we construct will be publicly available.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52% memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on efficiency test.

| **[MLLM-CL: Continual Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05453v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[EOC-Bench: Can MLLMs Identify, Recall, and Forecast Objects in an Egocentric World?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05287v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.</p></details> | 32pages |

Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld-V1, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld-V1 achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld-V1 framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMBoundary: Advancing MLLM Knowledge Boundary Awareness through Reasoning Step Confidence Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23224v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, ACL 2025 |
