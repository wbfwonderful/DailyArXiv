| **[MissionHD: Data-Driven Refinement of Reasoning Graph Structure through Hyperdimensional Causal Path Encoding and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Video Anomaly Detection via Deep Learning: Human, Vehicle, and Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14203v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GV-VAD : Exploring Video Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00312v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Evolution of Video Anomaly Detection: A Unified Framework from DNN to MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21649v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the VAD community.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding. Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU (Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category, semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric, which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[DAMS:Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20629v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS), which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information. The main processing path of this framework integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness of the DAMS framework.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was accepted by ACM MM 2025; Code: https://github.com/YihuaJerry/EventVAD</p></details> |
| **[HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17394v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets, thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning. Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 |

We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP.

| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential keypoint density estimator: an overlooked baseline of skeleton-based video anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18368v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MReg: A Novel Regression Model with MoE-based Video Feature Mining for Mitral Regurgitation Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23648v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at: https://github.com/cskdstz/MReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14565v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically analyze spatiotemporal patterns in surveillance videos collected from open spaces to detect anomalous events that may cause harm, such as fighting, stealing, and car accidents. However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13095v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos, utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML |

| **[VoCap: Video Object Captioning and Segmentation from Any Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21809v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding. In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions. We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement . https://github.com/Cola-any/Video-LevelGauge</p></details> |  |

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically, we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21010v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

Empowered by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for IJCV</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video understanding.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2) Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance. Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2 Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research community advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6figures |

| **[Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces, instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines. Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOMATO: Assessing Visual Temporal Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23266v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17047v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.</p></details> |  |
| **[See What You Need: Query-Aware Visual Intelligence through Reasoning-Perception Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17932v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However, current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames; (2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3) confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA (76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video understanding.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding and address a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). Our contributions are twofold: First, we frame temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem: finding a minimal set of relevant frames (e.g., one to five) from tens of thousands based on specific queries. Upon this formulation, we introduce LV-Haystack, the first dataset with 480 hours of videos, 15,092 human-annotated instances for both training and evaluation aiming to improve temporal search quality and efficiency. Results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with current SOTA search methods only achieving 2.1% temporal F1 score on the Longvideobench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we propose a lightweight temporal search framework, T* that reframes costly temporal search as spatial search. T* leverages powerful visual localization techniques commonly used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments show that integrating T* with existing methods significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding. Under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-OV-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on the Longvideobench XL subset.

While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.

| **[STORM: Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04130v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios. Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware compression approaches.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity, and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions. We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.</p></details> |  |

They continue, however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints. Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CoRI, a pipeline that automatically generates natural language communication of a robot's upcoming actions directly from its motion plan and visual perception. Our pipeline first processes the robot's image view to identify human poses and key environmental features. It then encodes the planned 3D spatial trajectory (including velocity and force) onto this view, visually grounding the path and its dynamics. CoRI queries a vision-language model with this visual representation to interpret the planned action within the visual context before generating concise, user-directed statements, without relying on task-specific information. Results from a user study involving robot-assisted feeding, bathing, and shaving tasks across two different robots indicate that CoRI leads to statistically significant difference in communication clarity compared to a baseline communication strategy. Specifically, CoRI effectively conveys not only the robot's high-level intentions but also crucial details about its motion and any collaborative user action needed.

A Comparative Study on Spatial Reasoning from Street-View Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21565v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[HCCM: Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching Learning for Natural Language-Guided Drones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21539v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM) framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM), which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous, destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'25</p></details> |

It was designed to advance the development and evaluation of vision-language models for agricultural decision-making and analysis. The PlantVillageVQA dataset comprises 193,609 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs grounded over 55,448 images spanning 14 crop species and 38 disease conditions. Questions are organised into 3 levels of cognitive complexity and 9 distinct categories. Each question category was phrased manually following expert guidance and generated via an automated two-stage pipeline: (1) template-based QA synthesis from image metadata and (2) multi-stage linguistic re-engineering. The dataset was iteratively reviewed by domain experts for scientific accuracy and relevancy. The final dataset was evaluated using three state-of-the-art models for quality assessment. Our objective remains to provide a publicly available, standardised and expert-verified database to enhance diagnostic accuracy for plant disease identifications and advance scientific research in the agricultural domain. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SyedNazmusSakib/PlantVillageVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 15 figures and Submittd to Nature Scientific Data</p></details> |

By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCAI2025 Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability</p></details> |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right.

However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |

Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing efforts largely overlook the intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants - text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR - across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the "concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring its practical value for real-world Document VQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Machine Learning in Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR WML 2025), Wuhan, China</p></details> |

| **[Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</p></details> |  |

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

If this were true, a drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to a similar area in the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that form the drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of teaching vision-language models a subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages (42 pages of appendix).

While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Drone Imagery to Livability Mapping: AI-powered Environment Perception in Rural China](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21738v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146 counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations. Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern, radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients; (2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural construction policy-making.</p></details> |  |

By violating chart design principles, they distort data and lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604 real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814 visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.

However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes, where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified during the initial glance.

However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Region-Level Context-Aware Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12263v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark are available at https://github.com/hongliang-wei/RC-MLLM</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.</p></details> |  |

However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[CVBench: Evaluating Cross-Video Synergies for Complex Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19542v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation MLLMs. The data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/Hokhim2/CVBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodecBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Acoustic and Semantic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20660v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of multimodal large language models (LLMs), audio codec plays an increasingly vital role in encoding audio into discrete tokens, enabling integration of audio into text-based LLMs. Current audio codec captures two types of information: acoustic and semantic. As audio codec is applied to diverse scenarios in speech language model , it needs to model increasingly complex information and adapt to varied contexts, such as scenarios with multiple speakers, background noise, or richer paralinguistic information. However, existing codec's own evaluation has been limited by simplistic metrics and scenarios, and existing benchmarks for audio codec are not designed for complex application scenarios, which limits the assessment performance on complex datasets for acoustic and semantic capabilities. We introduce CodecBench, a comprehensive evaluation dataset to assess audio codec performance from both acoustic and semantic perspectives across four data domains. Through this benchmark, we aim to identify current limitations, highlight future research directions, and foster advances in the development of audio codec. The codes are available at https://github.com/RayYuki/CodecBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUMMA: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Advertisement Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20582v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts, generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5% increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06989v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Tokens Talk Too Much: A Survey of Multimodal Long-Context Token Compression across Images, Videos, and Audios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20198v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.</p></details> | <details><summary>For o...</summary><p>For ongoing updates and to track the latest advances in this promising area, we maintain a public repository: https://github.com/cokeshao/Awesome-Multimodal-Token-Compression</p></details> |

Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces LatentExplainer, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. LatentExplainer tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interprets changes in generated data, and uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025 Full Research Track</p></details> |
| **[How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice. To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g., lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |

While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures (22 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings, Project Page: https://huggingface.co/AdaptLLM/Adapt-MLLM-to-Domains</p></details> |
