| **[FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11254v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Adaptive Multi-Stage Video Anomaly Reasoning: A Benchmark Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10165v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-Aligned Captions for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08155v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for safety-critical applications, yet even with recent progress, much of the research still lacks spatial grounding, making the explanations unverifiable. This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrismVAU: Prompt-Refined Inference System for Multimodal Video Anomaly Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02927v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 6th Workshop on Real-World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges (WACV 2026)</p></details> |
| **[VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693v3)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos. Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries. Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 poster |
| **[RefineVAD: Semantic-Guided Feature Recalibration for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13204v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to identify anomalous events using only video-level labels, balancing annotation efficiency with practical applicability. However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhance Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Coherence for Configurable Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07328v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) relies on technologies in the field of signal processing. Since the anomaly is quite ambiguous and unbounded, different detection demands may often be raised even in one scenario. Thus, we propose to design the configurable VAD with flexible solutions targeting to solve the issue that previous methods have to train their models from scratch and waste resources when detection demands even change slightly. Moreover, we also design a dataset with good compatibility to evaluate the VAD performance when changes happen in detection demands. Besides, videos contain important information regarding continuous changes in the object's appearance and motion. Thus, we also propose a module to establish the multi-scale spatial-temporal coherence, which improves the accuracy and has the ability to dynamically adjust and accurately capture spatial-temporal normal patterns. Experiments show that our method not only models coherence effectively but also has better configurable ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[HeadHunt-VAD: Hunting Robust Anomaly-Sensitive Heads in MLLM for Tuning-Free Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17601v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Oral |
| **[GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD). Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the reduction of redundant information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo Anomalies Are All You Need: Diffusion-Based Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06845v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying video anomaly detection in practice is hampered by the scarcity and collection cost of real abnormal footage. We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CADE: Continual Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06840v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has long been studied as a crucial problem in public security and crime prevention. In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the "incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v4)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Semantics-Aware Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods face two critical challenges: (1) Strong generalization blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal patterns. Although existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue using memory modules, their rigid prototype-matching process limits adaptability to diverse scenarios; (2) Relying solely on low-level appearance and motion cues makes it difficult to perceive high-level semantic anomalies in complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose SIB-VAD, a novel framework based on adaptive information bottleneck filtering and semantic-aware enhancement. We propose the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) to replace traditional memory modules. It compresses normal features directly into a low-dimensional manifold based on the information bottleneck principle and uses an adaptive routing mechanism to dynamically select the most suitable normal bottleneck subspace. Trained only on normal data, SFFMs only learn normal low-dimensional manifolds, while abnormal features deviate and are effectively filtered. Unlike memory modules, SFFM directly removes abnormal information and adaptively handles scene variations. To improve semantic awareness, we further design a multimodal prediction framework that jointly models appearance, motion, and semantics. Through multimodal consistency constraints and joint error computation, it achieves more robust VAD performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our feature filtering paradigm based on semantics-aware information bottleneck.

| **[Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v3)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Sparse Reasoning is Enough: Biological-Inspired Framework for Video Anomaly Detection with Large Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17094v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Time in Static Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12321v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

| **[Learning to Tell Apart: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection via Disentangled Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10334v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring, anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings, guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and 67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset, and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).</p></details> |  |

Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[Efficient On-Board Processing of Oblique UAV Video for Rapid Flood Extent Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11290v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural</p></details> |  |
| **[Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10611v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |

Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |

However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.</p></details> |  |

Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edge-Optimized Multimodal Learning for UAV Video Understanding via BLIP-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08408v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Tenth International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data (DMBD'2025)</p></details> |

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</p></details> |  |

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.</p></details> | 6 pages |

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, termed as image-to-video transfer learning, effectively mitigates the substantial data and computational demands compared to training video-language models from scratch while achieves comparable or even stronger model performance. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFMs and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning techniques into two broad root categories (frozen features and adapted features), along with numerous fine-grained subcategories, based on the paradigm for transferring image understanding capability to video tasks. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained settings (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained ones (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Multi-image reasoning presents fundamental challenges including complex inter-relationships between images and scattered critical information across image sets. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose the Cognition-Inspired Meta-Action Framework (CINEMA), a novel approach that decomposes multi-image reasoning into five structured meta-actions: Global, Focus, Hint, Think, and Answer which explicitly modeling the sequential cognitive steps humans naturally employ. For cold-start training, we introduce a Retrieval-Based Tree Sampling strategy that generates high-quality meta-action trajectories to bootstrap the model with reasoning patterns. During reinforcement learning, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: an exploration phase with Diversity-Preserving Strategy to avoid entropy collapse, followed by an annealed exploitation phase with DAPO to gradually strengthen exploitation. To train our model, we construct a dataset of 57k cold-start and 58k reinforcement learning instances spanning multi-image, multi-frame, and single-image tasks. We conduct extensive evaluations on multi-image reasoning benchmarks, video understanding benchmarks, and single-image benchmarks, achieving competitive state-of-the-art performance on several key benchmarks. Our model surpasses GPT-4o on the MUIR and MVMath benchmarks and notably outperforms specialized video reasoning models on video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our human cognition-inspired reasoning framework.</p></details> |  |

With this, VideoLoom achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across a variety of spatial and temporal benchmarks (e.g., 63.1 J&F on ReVOS for referring video object segmentation, and 48.3 R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for temporal grounding). In addition, we introduce LoomBench, a novel benchmark consisting of temporal, spatial, and compositional video-question pairs, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of Video LLMs from diverse aspects.

While recent advancements have introduced the visually guided acoustic highlighting task, which implicitly rebalances audio sources using multimodal guidance, it remains unclear which visual aspects are most effective as conditioning signals.We address this gap through a systematic study of whether deep video understanding improves audio remixing. Using textual descriptions as a proxy for visual analysis, we prompt large vision-language models to extract six types of visual-semantic aspects, including object and character appearance, emotion, camera focus, tone, scene background, and inferred sound-related cues. Through extensive experiments, camera focus, tone, and scene background consistently yield the largest improvements in perceptual mix quality over state-of-the-art baselines. Our findings (i) identify which visual-semantic cues most strongly support coherent and visually aligned audio remixing, and (ii) outline a practical path toward automating cinema-grade sound design using lightweight guidance derived from large vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speak While Watching: Unleashing TRUE Real-Time Video Understanding Capability of Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06843v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance across many tasks, yet most systems remain limited to offline inference, requiring complete inputs before generating outputs. Recent streaming methods reduce latency by interleaving perception and generation, but still enforce a sequential perception-generation cycle, limiting real-time interaction. In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency. We further show that the proposed framework yields up to 2x acceleration under balanced perception-generation workloads, establishing a principled pathway toward speak-while-watching real-time systems. We make all our code publicly available: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/Speak-While-Watching.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce QMAVIS (Q Team-Multimodal Audio Video Intelligent Sensemaking), a novel long video-audio understanding pipeline built through a late fusion of LMMs, Large Language Models, and speech recognition models. QMAVIS addresses the gap in long-form video analytics, particularly for longer videos of a few minutes to beyond an hour long, opening up new potential applications in sensemaking, video content analysis, embodied AI, etc. Quantitative experiments using QMAVIS demonstrated a 38.75% improvement over state-of-the-art video-audio LMMs like VideoLlaMA2 and InternVL2 on the VideoMME (with subtitles) dataset, which comprises long videos with audio information. Evaluations on other challenging video understanding datasets like PerceptionTest and EgoSchema saw up to 2% improvement, indicating competitive performance. Qualitative experiments also showed that QMAVIS is able to extract the nuances of different scenes in a long video audio content while understanding the overarching narrative. Ablation studies were also conducted to ascertain the impact of each component in the fusion pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://facebookresearch.github.io/ShapeR Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbY30KAA55I</p></details> |

While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACoT-VLA: Action Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11404v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on AI</p></details> |

However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VINO: A Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02358v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sotamak1r.github.io/VINO-web/</p></details> |
| **[Language-Agnostic Visual Embeddings for Cross-Script Handwriting Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11248v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.</p></details> | 9 pages,5 figures |
| **[Robot-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Embodied Reasoning in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00070v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate predictions. To rigorously evaluate Robot-R1, we also introduce a new benchmark that demands the diverse embodied reasoning capabilities for the task. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters, Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action control, such as spatial and movement reasoning.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Attention Debiasing for Token Pruning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17807v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) typically encode substantially more visual tokens than text tokens, resulting in significant token redundancy. Pruning uninformative visual tokens is therefore crucial for improving computational efficiency, and language-to-vision attention has become a widely used importance criterion for this purpose. However, we find that attention in VLMs is systematically biased. It disproportionately favors tokens appearing later in the sequence, manifesting as over-attention to lower image regions, and assigns inflated scores to semantically empty padding tokens. These behaviors stem from intrinsic recency bias and attention sink effects inherited from large language models (LLMs), and they distort attention-based pruning by preserving irrelevant visual content. To derive a pruning criterion better aligned with semantic relevance, we introduce two lightweight yet effective debiasing techniques that restore the reliability of attention. The first compensates for positional distortions by removing recency-induced attention trends, producing a content-aware and position-agnostic importance measure. The second suppresses attention sink effects by eliminating spurious attention on padding tokens. Our method is model-agnostic, pruning-method-agnostic, and task-agnostic, enabling plug-and-play integration with existing VLM pruning models. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently delivers strong performance gains. We evaluate our method on ten vision-language benchmarks spanning both image-based and video-based tasks, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art visual token pruning methods and across two representative VLM architectures. Our method achieves substantial performance gains, demonstrating strong effectiveness and generalizability.

| **[Cascading multi-agent anomaly detection in surveillance systems via vision-language models and embedding-based classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06204v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author email changed, Acknowlegement changes</p></details> |
| **[MERGETUNE: Continued fine-tuning of vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10497v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, continued fine-tuning (CFT), which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model. Our code is available at https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> |

Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://image2garment.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alterbute: Editing Intrinsic Attributes of Objects in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10714v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://talreiss.github.io/alterbute/</p></details> |

This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal large language models (mLLMs) promise to enable such analyses through in-context learning. However, we lack systematic evidence on whether these models can reliably measure emotions in real-world political settings. This paper evaluates leading mLLMs for video-based emotional arousal measurement using two complementary human-labeled video datasets: recordings created under laboratory conditions and real-world parliamentary debates. I find a critical lab-vs-field performance gap. In video created under laboratory conditions, mLLMs arousal scores approach human-level reliability with little to no demographic bias. However, in parliamentary debate recordings, all examined models' arousal scores correlate at best moderately with average human ratings and exhibit systematic bias by speaker gender and age. Neither relying on leading closed-source mLLMs nor computational noise mitigation strategies change this finding. Further, mLLMs underperform even in sentiment analysis when using video recordings instead of text transcripts of the same speeches. These findings reveal important limitations of current mLLMs for real-world political video analysis and establish a rigorous evaluation framework for tracking future developments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an earlier version of the work released in May 2025.

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</p></details> | 41 pages, 22 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collected the raw data from six fields and aligned it via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee quality and compliance. After that, we constructed an Affect Table to constrain annotation. We used five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze both modalities, and their outputs were fused with the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess the InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.608, which indicates high accuracy.

We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.05879</p></details> |

Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce MADIAVE, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EACL 2026 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Uncertainty Guided Policy Learning for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01444v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models. However, existing methods typically treat visual inputs as deterministic, overlooking the perceptual ambiguity inherent to the visual modality. Consequently, they fail to distinguish whether a model's uncertainty stems from complex reasoning or ambiguous perception, preventing the targeted allocation of exploration or learning signals. To address this gap, we introduce DUPL, a dual-uncertainty guided policy learning approach for multimodal RLVR that quantifies and leverages both perceptual uncertainty (via symmetric KL divergence) and output uncertainty (via policy entropy) to guide policy updates. By establishing an uncertainty-driven feedback loop and employing a dynamic branch prioritization mechanism, DUPL recalibrates the policy advantage to focus learning on states with high perceptual or decisional ambiguity, enabling effective targeted exploration beyond passive data augmentation. Implemented on top of GRPO and evaluated on six multimodal mathematical and general-domain reasoning benchmarks, DUPL improves Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 11.2% on visual math tasks and up to 7.1% on general-domain reasoning tasks, while consistently outperforming GRPO. These results demonstrate that dual-uncertainty guided policy learning is an effective and generalizable approach for multimodal RLVR.</p></details> |  |

However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMHBench: Benchmarking Balanced and Grounded Omni-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16198v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have increasingly supported omni-modal processing across text, vision, and speech. However, existing evaluation frameworks for such models suffer from critical limitations, including modality shortcuts and biased reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we propose OMHBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate omni-modal multi-hop reasoning. It consists of 6,144 questions with balanced reasoning paths that are jointly grounded across all three modalities. Extensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art models reveals that (1) a large performance gap exists between proprietary and open-source MLLMs and (2) even proprietary models exhibit high sensitivity to reasoning path variations, resulting in asymmetric omni-modal grounding. Notably, models struggle when processing the speech modality, underscoring the need for balanced, multi-hop evaluation of omni-modal intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |
| **[MoST: Mixing Speech and Text with Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10272v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST</p></details> |  |

Such settings require models to maintain coherent understanding and reasoning as visual scenes evolve over time. **We introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for real-time video analysis with MLLMs**. It is built upon three key principles: multi-timestamp question answering, hierarchical question structures spanning perception and reasoning, and multi-dimensional evaluation of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench comprises 552 diverse videos and 4,608 carefully curated QA pairs covering a wide range of dynamic scenarios. We evaluate a broad range of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source offline, and open-source real-time models. Our results show that real-time models generally outperform offline counterparts but still lag behind leading proprietary systems. While scaling model capacity generally yields performance gains, simply increasing the density of sampled input frames does not consistently translate into improved results. These observations suggest inherent limitations in current architectures when handling long-horizon video streams, underscoring the need for models explicitly designed for streaming video processing and analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track;</p></details> |

| **[Advancing Adaptive Multi-Stage Video Anomaly Reasoning: A Benchmark Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10165v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIN-Bench: Tracing Native Evidence Chains in Long-Context Multimodal Scientific Interleaved Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10108v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.</p></details> |  |

A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045v5)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 27 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09536v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
