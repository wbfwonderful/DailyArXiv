| **[Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11777v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Vad-R1: Towards Video Anomaly Reasoning via Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19877v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks. However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at https://github.com/wbfwonderful/Vad-R1.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[MissionGNN: Hierarchical Multimodal GNN-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition with Mission-Specific Knowledge Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18815v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of escalating safety concerns across various domains, the tasks of Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) and Video Anomaly Recognition (VAR) have emerged as critically important for applications in intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, violence alerting, etc. These tasks, aimed at identifying and classifying deviations from normal behavior in video data, face significant challenges due to the rarity of anomalies which leads to extremely imbalanced data and the impracticality of extensive frame-level data annotation for supervised learning. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) based model MissionGNN that addresses these challenges by leveraging a state-of-the-art large language model and a comprehensive knowledge graph for efficient weakly supervised learning in VAR. Our approach circumvents the limitations of previous methods by avoiding heavy gradient computations on large multimodal models and enabling fully frame-level training without fixed video segmentation. Utilizing automated, mission-specific knowledge graph generation, our model provides a practical and efficient solution for real-time video analysis without the constraints of previous segmentation-based or multimodal approaches. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates our model's performance in VAD and VAR, highlighting its potential to redefine the landscape of anomaly detection and recognition in video surveillance systems.

| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, two fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $π$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors. Code and models are available at https://github.com/EavnJeong/IEF-VAD.</p></details> |  |

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Networking Systems for Video Anomaly Detection: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10347v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities, coupled with the surge of online video applications, has heightened concerns regarding public security and privacy protection, which propelled automated Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) into a fundamental research task within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. With the advancements in deep learning and edge computing, VAD has made significant progress and advances synergized with emerging applications in smart cities and video internet, which has moved beyond the conventional research scope of algorithm engineering to deployable Networking Systems for VAD (NSVAD), a practical hotspot for intersection exploration in the AI, IoVT, and computing fields. In this article, we delineate the foundational assumptions, learning frameworks, and applicable scenarios of various deep learning-driven VAD routes, offering an exhaustive tutorial for novices in NSVAD. In addition, this article elucidates core concepts by reviewing recent advances and typical solutions and aggregating available research resources accessible at https://github.com/fdjingliu/NSVAD.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work.

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  |

We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.</p></details> |  |

Recent video generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision, which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment, which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.</p></details> |  |

We investigate how extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills of underlying LLMs influence this strong performance. Surprisingly, we discover that LLM-based approaches can yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks with limited video information, sometimes even with no video specific information. Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks. Strong performance also on robotics domain tasks establish its strong generality.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial tampering and manipulations remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MVTamperBench}, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping; based on real-world visual tampering scenarios such as surveillance interference, social media content edits, and misinformation injection. MVTamperBench comprises ~3.4K original videos, expanded into over ~17K tampered clips covering 19 distinct video manipulation tasks. This benchmark challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families. We reveal substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and show that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms. We release all code, data, and benchmark to foster open research in trustworthy video understanding.

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption.

Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings.

Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the internet.</p></details> |  |

Through large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding, most existing open-source models rely on over 7B parameters and require large-scale datasets for training, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible to many researchers. Furthermore, lightweight models face persistent challenges in effectively processing long visual sequences and temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce TinyLLaVA-Video, a lightweight yet powerful video understanding model with approximately 3.6B parameters. The cornerstone of our design is the video-level group resampler, a novel mechanism that significantly reduces and controls the number of visual tokens at the video level. Unlike traditional image-level resampler, our approach effectively mitigates redundancy while enhancing temporal comprehension, leading to improved performance on video-based tasks. In addition, TinyLLaVA-Video demonstrates exceptional efficiency, requiring only one day of training on 8 A100-40G GPUs. It surpasses several existing 7B-parameter models on multiple benchmarks. We believe this work provides a valuable foundation for future research on lightweight video understanding models.

Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1 significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and captioning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CyberV: Cybernetics for Test-time Scaling in Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07971v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time, lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0% improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts. Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for dynamic video understanding.

Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's flexible upgrading over narration vocabulary. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.

Current RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content, confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super Encoding Network: Recursive Association of Multi-Modal Encoders for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07576v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently, multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association (RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition, chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%, and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video approach.</p></details> |  |

Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 412 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 2,000 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization, the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain generalization.

| **[How Visual Representations Map to Language Feature Space in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11976v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Multilingual Vision-Language Translation: Dataset, Evaluation, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11820v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact. By highlighting key design strategies, current challenges, and offering recommendations for future directions, this survey aims to inspire further research into the practical deployment of VLMs, ultimately making advanced AI accessible in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively.

| **[Beyond the Visible: Multispectral Vision-Language Learning for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15969v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTabVQA: Evaluating Multi-Tabular Reasoning of Language Models in Visual Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11684v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mtabvqa/MTabVQA-Eval) are available online (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MTabVQA-EMNLP-B16E).</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVA-CMoE: Towards Continual Mixture of Experts for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21227v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have recently advanced the scalability and adaptability of large language models (LLMs) for continual multimodal learning. However, efficiently extending these models to accommodate sequential tasks remains challenging. As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to rapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes catastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs that requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter efficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to dynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling adaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity. Furthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a dedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels are unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy to identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing automatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing conflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning without explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark, covering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong continual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly reducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods. These results showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models. Our code will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> | Preprint |

In contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics, history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing multimodal benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning, lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset and evaluation code.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Workshop on Test-time Scaling for Computer Vision</p></details> |

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Natural Robustness of Vision-Language Models Against Visual Perception Attacks in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11472v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC), and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.</p></details> |  |

We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops 2025 (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, most existing CLIP-based ZFSAD methods commonly assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully crafted prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While such meticulously designed text prompts effectively capture semantic information in the textual space, they fall short of distinguishing normal and anomalous instances within the joint embedding space. Moreover, these ZFSAD methods are predominantly explored in industrial scenarios, with few efforts conducted to medical tasks. To this end, we propose an innovative framework for ZFSAD tasks in medical domain, denoted as IQE-CLIP. We reveal that query embeddings, which incorporate both textual and instance-aware visual information, are better indicators for abnormalities. Specifically, we first introduce class-based prompting tokens and learnable prompting tokens for better adaptation of CLIP to the medical domain. Then, we design an instance-aware query module (IQM) to extract region-level contextual information from both text prompts and visual features, enabling the generation of query embeddings that are more sensitive to anomalies. Extensive experiments conducted on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both zero-shot and few-shot tasks. We release our code and data at https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Benchmark for Color Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10514v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Color plays an important role in human perception and usually provides critical clues in visual reasoning. However, it is unclear whether and how vision-language models (VLMs) can perceive, understand, and leverage color as humans. This paper introduces ColorBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to assess the capabilities of VLMs in color understanding, including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. By curating a suite of diverse test scenarios, with grounding in real applications, ColorBench evaluates how these models perceive colors, infer meanings from color-based cues, and maintain consistent performance under varying color transformations. Through an extensive evaluation of 32 VLMs with varying language models and vision encoders, our paper reveals some undiscovered findings: (i) The scaling law (larger models are better) still holds on ColorBench, while the language model plays a more important role than the vision encoder. (ii) However, the performance gaps across models are relatively small, indicating that color understanding has been largely neglected by existing VLMs. (iii) CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, though they are vision-centric tasks. (iv) Color clues are indeed leveraged by VLMs on ColorBench but they can also mislead models in some tasks. These findings highlight the critical limitations of current VLMs and underscore the need to enhance color comprehension. Our ColorBenchcan serve as a foundational tool for advancing the study of human-level color understanding of multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, including references and appendix.

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are in Supp.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), these models often struggle to capture the nuanced, spatiotemporal details essential for thorough video analysis. To address this gap, we introduce Video-CoT, a groundbreaking dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal understanding using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodologies. Video-CoT contains 192,000 fine-grained spa-tiotemporal question-answer pairs and 23,000 high-quality CoT-annotated samples, providing a solid foundation for evaluating spatiotemporal understanding in video comprehension. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities.

| **[VGR: Visual Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11991v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

It serves as an essential testing ground for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work, we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex real-world vision-language tasks.

The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the 1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152 strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5, Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors could not reach a consensus on the final version of this paper, necessitating its withdrawal</p></details> |

Although existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts (D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite the superior performance of MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this paper also reviews various types of attacks in the latest audio-visual-based MLLMs, a dimension notably absent in existing surveys. Drawing upon comprehensive insights from a substantial review, this paper delineates both challenges and emergent trends for future research on audio-visual attacks and defense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manager: Aggregating Insights from Unimodal Experts in Two-Tower VLMs and MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11515v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations, \textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture. In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion. First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture. We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images, and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

| **[Lingshu: A Generalist Foundation Model for Unified Multimodal Medical Understanding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07044v4)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures.

| **[Stop learning it all to mitigate visual hallucination, Focus on the hallucination target](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11417v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs without diminishing overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scientists' First Exam: Probing Cognitive Abilities of MLLM via Perception, Understanding, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10521v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.</p></details> | 82 pages |
| **[Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs on Recognition and Understanding over Chemical Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11375v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity, limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition, covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding, encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for advancing scientific reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

| **[Breaking Bad Molecules: Are MLLMs Ready for Structure-Level Molecular Detoxification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10912v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Ponder: A Unified Training Pipeline for Reasoning-based Visual Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05384v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses. Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>{\dag...</summary><p>{\dag}: Equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Can Sound Replace Vision in LLaVA With Token Substitution?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10416v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal systems have achieved impressive advances, they typically rely on text-aligned representations rather than directly integrating audio and visual inputs. This reliance can limit the use of acoustic information in tasks requiring nuanced audio understanding. In response, SoundCLIP explores direct audio-visual integration within multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by substituting CLIP's visual tokens with audio representations and selecting sound-relevant patch tokens in models such as LLaVA. We investigate two configurations: (1) projecting audio features into CLIP's visual manifold via a multilayer perceptron trained with InfoNCE on paired audio-video segments, and (2) preserving raw audio embeddings with minimal dimensional adjustments. Experiments with five state-of-the-art audio encoders reveal a fundamental trade-off. While audio-to-video retrieval performance increases dramatically (up to 44 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy) when audio is projected into CLIP's space, text generation quality declines. Encoders pre-trained with text supervision (CLAP, Whisper, ImageBind) maintain stronger generative capabilities than those focused primarily on audiovisual alignment (Wav2CLIP, AudioCLIP), highlighting the value of language exposure for generation tasks. We introduce WhisperCLIP, an architecture that fuses intermediate representations from Whisper, as well as AudioVisual Event Evaluation (AVE-2), a dataset of 580,147 three-second audiovisual clips with fine-grained alignment annotations. Our findings challenge the assumption that stronger cross-modal alignment necessarily benefits all multimodal tasks; instead, a Pareto frontier emerges wherein optimal performance depends on balancing retrieval accuracy with text generation quality.

TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS, with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future research.

| **[MLLM-Based UI2Code Automation Guided by UI Layout Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10376v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Converting user interfaces into code (UI2Code) is a crucial step in website development, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The automation of UI2Code is essential to streamline this task, beneficial for improving the development efficiency. There exist deep learning-based methods for the task; however, they heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data and struggle with generalizing to real-world, unseen web page designs. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved. To address these issues, we propose LayoutCoder, a novel MLLM-based framework generating UI code from real-world webpage images, which includes three key modules: (1) Element Relation Construction, which aims at capturing UI layout by identifying and grouping components with similar structures; (2) UI Layout Parsing, which aims at generating UI layout trees for guiding the subsequent code generation process; and (3) Layout-Guided Code Fusion, which aims at producing the accurate code with layout preserved. For evaluation, we build a new benchmark dataset which involves 350 real-world websites named Snap2Code, divided into seen and unseen parts for mitigating the data leakage issue, besides the popular dataset Design2Code. Extensive evaluation shows the superior performance of LayoutCoder over the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the best-performing baseline, LayoutCoder improves 10.14% in the BLEU score and 3.95% in the CLIP score on average across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
