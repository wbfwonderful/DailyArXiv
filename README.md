| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Just Dance with $Ï€$! A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/modadundun/ProDisc-VAD.</p></details> |  |

Most video anomaly detection approaches focus either on surveillance or traffic accidents, which are only a subfield of autonomous driving. We present HF$^2$-VAD$_{AD}$, a variation of the HF$^2$-VAD surveillance video anomaly detection method for autonomous driving. We learn a representation of normality from a vehicle's ego perspective and evaluate pixel-wise anomaly detections in rare and critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel Bogdoll and Jan Imhof contributed equally.

| **[Advancing Video Anomaly Detection: A Bi-Directional Hybrid Framework for Enhanced Single- and Multi-Task Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14753v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlowFastVAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Integrating Simple Detector and RAG-Enhanced Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10320v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify unexpected events in videos and has wide applications in safety-critical domains. While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVadCLIP: Audio-Visual Collaboration for Robust Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04495v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of video anomaly detection in intelligent surveillance domains, conventional visual-based detection approaches often struggle with information insufficiency and high false-positive rates in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v6)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional performance in video anomaly detection (VAD). However, most systems remain black boxes, lacking explainability during training and inference. A key challenge is integrating explicit knowledge into implicit models to create expert-driven, interpretable VAD systems. This paper introduces Rule-based Violence Monitoring (RuleVM), a novel weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD) paradigm. RuleVM employs a dual-branch architecture: an implicit branch using visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, with feature extraction split into scene frames and action channels, and an explicit branch leveraging language-image alignment for fine-grained classification. The explicit branch utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for object detection in video frames, with association rules mined from data as video descriptors. This design enables interpretable coarse- and fine-grained violence monitoring. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show RuleVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both granularities. Notably, it reveals rules like increased violence risk with crowd size.

| **[VERA: Explainable Video Anomaly Detection via Verbalized Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01095v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has established a new paradigm in video anomaly detection (VAD): leveraging VLMs to simultaneously detect anomalies and provide comprehendible explanations for the decisions. Existing work in this direction often assumes the complex reasoning required for VAD exceeds the capabilities of pretrained VLMs. Consequently, these approaches either incorporate specialized reasoning modules during inference or rely on instruction tuning datasets through additional training to adapt VLMs for VAD. However, such strategies often incur substantial computational costs or data annotation overhead. To address these challenges in explainable VAD, we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically, VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler, more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs, using coarsely labeled training data. During inference, VERA embeds the learned questions into model prompts to guide VLMs in generating segment-level anomaly scores, which are then refined into frame-level scores via the fusion of scene and temporal contexts. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the learned questions of VERA are highly adaptable, significantly improving both detection performance and explainability of VLMs for VAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[AssistPDA: An Online Video Surveillance Assistant for Video Anomaly Prediction, Detection, and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21904v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in LLM-based video anomaly detection (VAD). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on video-level anomaly question answering or offline detection, ignoring the real-time nature essential for practical VAD applications. To bridge this gap and facilitate the practical deployment of LLM-based VAD, we introduce AssistPDA, the first online video anomaly surveillance assistant that unifies video anomaly prediction, detection, and analysis (VAPDA) within a single framework. AssistPDA enables real-time inference on streaming videos while supporting interactive user engagement. Notably, we introduce a novel event-level anomaly prediction task, enabling proactive anomaly forecasting before anomalies fully unfold. To enhance the ability to model intricate spatiotemporal relationships in anomaly events, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Relation Distillation (STRD) module. STRD transfers the long-term spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) from offline settings to real-time scenarios. Thus it equips AssistPDA with a robust understanding of complex temporal dependencies and long-sequence memory. Additionally, we construct VAPDA-127K, the first large-scale benchmark designed for VLM-based online VAPDA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AssistPDA outperforms existing offline VLM-based approaches, setting a new state-of-the-art for real-time VAPDA. Our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The emergence of state space models in computer vision, exemplified by the Mamba model, demonstrates improved computational efficiency through selective scans and showcases the great potential for long-range modeling. Our study pioneers the application of Mamba to VAD, dubbed VADMamba, which is based on multi-task learning for frame prediction and optical flow reconstruction. Specifically, we propose the VQ-Mamba Unet (VQ-MaU) framework, which incorporates a Vector Quantization (VQ) layer and Mamba-based Non-negative Visual State Space (NVSS) block. Furthermore, two individual VQ-MaU networks separately predict frames and reconstruct corresponding optical flows, further boosting accuracy through a clip-level fusion evaluation strategy. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed VADMamba across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in inference speed compared to previous work.

| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a vital yet complex open-set task in computer vision, commonly tackled through reconstruction-based methods. However, these methods struggle with two key limitations: (1) insufficient robustness in open-set scenarios, where unseen normal motions are frequently misclassified as anomalies, and (2) an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, local motion reconstruction, which are inherently difficult to capture accurately due to their diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training. First, we enhance robustness by training a generator to produce perturbed samples, which are similar to normal samples and target the weakness of the reconstruction model. This training paradigm expands the reconstruction domain of the model, improving its generalization to unseen normal motions. Second, to address the overemphasis on motion details, we employ the 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate high-frequency (local) and low-frequency (global) motion components. By guiding the diffusion model with observed high-frequency information, we prioritize the reconstruction of low-frequency components, enabling more accurate and robust anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on five widely used VAD datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in open-set scenarios and diverse motion contexts.

| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Contours -- A Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19588v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection prior art is rooted on the assumption that abnormal events can be mostly regarded as a result of uncommon human behavior. Opposed to utilizing skeleton representations of humans, however, we investigate the potential of learning recurrent motion patterns of normal human behavior using 2D contours. Keeping all advantages of pose-based methods, such as increased object anonymization, the shift from human skeletons to contours is hypothesized to leave the opportunity to cover more object categories open for future research. We propose formulating the problem as a regression and a classification task, and additionally explore two distinct data representation techniques for contours. To further reduce the computational complexity of Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection solutions, all methods in this study are based on shallow Neural Networks from the field of Deep Learning, and evaluated on the three most prominent benchmark datasets within Video Anomaly Detection and their human-related counterparts, totaling six datasets. Our results indicate that this novel perspective on Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection marks a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18808v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Anomize: Better Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18094v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Adaptive Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Framework and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14329v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify human behaviors that deviate from normal. At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/HuVAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 27 figures |

Inspired by the success of large models, we evaluate and leverage leading accessible multimodal large models and adapt them to video understanding tasks via few-shot learning and model ensemble strategies. Specifically, diversified prompt styles and process paradigms are systematically explored and evaluated to effectively guide the attention of large models, fully unleashing their powerful generalization and adaptability abilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, with our carefully designed approach, directly utilizing an individual multimodal model already outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method which includes several additional processes. Besides, an additional stage is further introduced that facilitates the cooperation and ensemble of periodic results, which achieves impressive performance improvements. We hope this work serves as a valuable reference for the practical application of large models and inspires future research in the field.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the extensive SoccerNet dataset, enriched with jersey color annotations and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, SoccerChat is fine-tuned on a structured video instruction dataset to facilitate accurate game understanding, event classification, and referee decision making. We benchmark SoccerChat on action classification and referee decision-making tasks, demonstrating its performance in general soccer event comprehension while maintaining competitive accuracy in referee decision making.

However, it remains computationally prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference. Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[How Well Can General Vision-Language Models Learn Medicine By Watching Public Educational Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14391v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Publicly available biomedical videos, such as those on YouTube, serve as valuable educational resources for medical students. Unlike standard machine learning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing medical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing. In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on image tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their respective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video evaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks, MIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves gains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%, respectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform biomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than those seen during training. These results suggest that educational videos created for human learning offer a surprisingly effective training signal for biomedical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA) that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability across multiple video domains.

| **[Clapper: Compact Learning and Video Representation in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15529v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse video understanding applications. Designing VLMs for video inputs requires effectively modeling the temporal dimension (i.e. capturing dependencies across frames) and balancing the processing of short and long videos. Specifically, short videos demand preservation of fine-grained details, whereas long videos require strategic compression of visual information to handle extensive temporal contexts efficiently. However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical limitation: most existing VLMs suffer severe performance degradation in long video understanding tasks when compressing visual tokens below a quarter of their original visual tokens. To enable more effective modeling of both short and long video inputs, we propose Clapper, a method that utilizes a slow-fast strategy for video representation and introduces a novel module named TimePerceiver for efficient temporal-spatial encoding within existing VLM backbones. By using our method, we achieves 13x compression of visual tokens per frame (averaging 61 tokens/frame) without compromising QA accuracy. In our experiments, Clapper achieves 62.0% on VideoMME, 69.8% on MLVU, and 67.4% on TempCompass, all with fewer than 6,000 visual tokens per video. The code will be publicly available on the homepage.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViaRL: Adaptive Temporal Grounding via Visual Iterated Amplification Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15447v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01805v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video spatial reasoning, which involves inferring the underlying spatial structure from observed video frames, poses a significant challenge for existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This limitation stems primarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2) the lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning capabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims to improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this end, we introduce the $\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present $\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial reasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining general multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\textbf{Spatially-Guided RLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism, which encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process, thereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while maintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g., Video-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench). Remarkably, SpaceR surpasses the advanced GPT-4o by 11.6\% accuracy on VSI-Bench and is on par with the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.0-Flash, highlighting the effectiveness of our SpaceR-151k dataset and SG-RLVR in reinforcing spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs. Code, model, and dataset are available at https://github.com/OuyangKun10/SpaceR.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering, neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed, LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$ number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames, while maintaining the same or better model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Multimodal Graph-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15192v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.</p></details> |  |

Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks.

However, our investigation reveals a rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer; Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer, which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of progress in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/VideoEval-Pro, Project Webpage: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoEval-Pro</p></details> |

Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames, effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only 25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame Compression Adjustment strategy is compatible with other token compression methods to further improve their performance.

| **[Breaking Down Video LLM Benchmarks: Knowledge, Spatial Perception, or True Temporal Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14321v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data. To ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research, we have open-sourced all model weights and training recipes at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main/InternLM-XComposer-2.5-Reward</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLAMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at "mixed precision" through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLAMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLAMP's superior performance across five video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLAMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

However, existing benchmarks are either severely limited in terms of video length and task diversity, or they focus solely on the end-to-end LVU performance, making them inappropriate for evaluating whether key moments can be accurately accessed. To address this challenge, we propose MomentSeeker, a novel benchmark for long-video moment retrieval (LMVR), distinguished by the following features. First, it is created based on long and diverse videos, averaging over 1200 seconds in duration and collected from various domains, e.g., movie, anomaly, egocentric, and sports. Second, it covers a variety of real-world scenarios in three levels: global-level, event-level, object-level, covering common tasks like action recognition, object localization, and causal reasoning, etc. Third, it incorporates rich forms of queries, including text-only queries, image-conditioned queries, and video-conditioned queries. On top of MomentSeeker, we conduct comprehensive experiments for both generation-based approaches (directly using MLLMs) and retrieval-based approaches (leveraging video retrievers). Our results reveal the significant challenges in long-video moment retrieval in terms of accuracy and efficiency, despite improvements from the latest long-video MLLMs and task-specific fine-tuning. We have publicly released MomentSeeker(https://yhy-2000.github.io/MomentSeeker/) to facilitate future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing. We will keep tracing related works at https://github.com/Chen-Yang-Liu/Awesome-RS-SpatioTemporal-VLMs</p></details> |  |

Selective Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16854v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering, leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/kokolerk/TON.</p></details> |  |

In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning, overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition, metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2% improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

However, existing approaches often struggle with efficient integration and realtime decision-making due to computational demands. In this paper, we introduce SOLVE, an innovative framework that synergizes VLMs with end-to-end (E2E) models to enhance autonomous vehicle planning. Our approach emphasizes knowledge sharing at the feature level through a shared visual encoder, enabling comprehensive interaction between VLM and E2E components. We propose a Trajectory Chain-of-Thought (T-CoT) paradigm, which progressively refines trajectory predictions, reducing uncertainty and improving accuracy. By employing a temporal decoupling strategy, SOLVE achieves efficient cooperation by aligning high-quality VLM outputs with E2E real-time performance. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, our method demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, paving the way for more robust and reliable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce REOBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of Earth observation foundation models across six tasks and twelve types of image corruptions, including both appearance-based and geometric perturbations. To ensure realistic and fine-grained evaluation, our benchmark focuses on high-resolution optical remote sensing images, which are widely used in critical applications such as urban planning and disaster response. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a broad range of models trained using masked image modeling, contrastive learning, and vision-language pre-training paradigms. Our results reveal that (1) existing Earth observation foundation models experience significant performance degradation when exposed to input corruptions. (2) The severity of degradation varies across tasks, model architectures, backbone sizes, and types of corruption, with performance drop varying from less than 1% to over 20%. (3) Vision-language models show enhanced robustness, particularly in multimodal tasks. REOBench underscores the vulnerability of current Earth observation foundation models to real-world corruptions and provides actionable insights for developing more robust and reliable models.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Single Domain Generalization for Few-Shot Counting via Universal Representation Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16778v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot counting estimates the number of target objects in an image using only a few annotated exemplars. However, domain shift severely hinders existing methods to generalize to unseen scenarios. This falls into the realm of single domain generalization that remains unexplored in few-shot counting. To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the main limitations of current methods, which typically follow a standard pipeline that extract the object prototypes from exemplars and then match them with image feature to construct the correlation map. We argue that existing methods overlook the significance of learning highly generalized prototypes. Building on this insight, we propose the first single domain generalization few-shot counting model, Universal Representation Matching, termed URM. Our primary contribution is the discovery that incorporating universal vision-language representations distilled from a large scale pretrained vision-language model into the correlation construction process substantially improves robustness to domain shifts without compromising in domain performance. As a result, URM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in domain and the newly introduced domain generalization setting.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[IFEval-Audio: Benchmarking Instruction-Following Capability in Audio-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16774v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280 audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content, Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link:...</summary><p>Link: https://github.com/AudioLLMs/AudioBench/tree/main/IFEval-Audio</p></details> |
| **[InSpire: Vision-Language-Action Models with Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13888v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to map language instruction and visual observations to raw low-level actions, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold great promise for achieving general-purpose robotic systems. Despite their advancements, existing VLAs tend to spuriously correlate task-irrelevant visual features with actions, limiting their generalization capacity beyond the training data. To tackle this challenge, we propose Intrinsic Spatial Reasoning (InSpire), a simple yet effective approach that mitigates the adverse effects of spurious correlations by boosting the spatial reasoning ability of VLAs. Specifically, InSpire redirects the VLA's attention to task-relevant factors by prepending the question "In which direction is the [object] relative to the robot?" to the language instruction and aligning the answer "right/left/up/down/front/back/grasped" and predicted actions with the ground-truth. Notably, InSpire can be used as a plugin to enhance existing autoregressive VLAs, requiring no extra training data or interaction with other large models. Extensive experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach. Our code, pretrained models and demos are publicly available at: https://Koorye.github.io/proj/Inspire.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Rewarding Large Vision-Language Models for Optimizing Prompts in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16763v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong competitors.</p></details> |  |

GeoBiked is curated to contain 4 355 bicycle images, annotated with structural and technical features and is used to investigate two automated labeling techniques: The utilization of consolidated latent features (Hyperfeatures) from image-generation models to detect geometric correspondences (e.g. the position of the wheel center) in structural images and the generation of diverse text descriptions for structural images. GPT-4o, a vision-language-model (VLM), is instructed to analyze images and produce diverse descriptions aligned with the system-prompt. By representing technical images as Diffusion-Hyperfeatures, drawing geometric correspondences between them is possible. The detection accuracy of geometric points in unseen samples is improved by presenting multiple annotated source images. GPT-4o has sufficient capabilities to generate accurate descriptions of technical images. Grounding the generation only on images leads to diverse descriptions but causes hallucinations, while grounding it on categorical labels restricts the diversity. Using both as input balances creativity and accuracy. Successfully using Hyperfeatures for geometric correspondence suggests that this approach can be used for general point-detection and annotation tasks in technical images. Labeling such images with text descriptions using VLMs is possible, but dependent on the models detection capabilities, careful prompt-engineering and the selection of input information. Applying foundation models in engineering design is largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap with a dataset to explore training, finetuning and conditioning DGMs in this field and suggesting approaches to bootstrap foundation models to process technical images.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains: detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg (segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).</p></details> |  |
| **[SD-MAD: Sign-Driven Few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16659v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial for early clinical intervention, yet it faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality medical imaging data, caused by privacy concerns and data silos. Few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Our objective is to evaluate whether instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However, trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a promising step toward explainable and versatile medical AI.

To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities.

Existing methods rely on predefined 3D object priors, limiting generalization to novel objects, which restricts their generalizability to novel objects. Meanwhile, recent multimodal approaches suffer from ambiguous generation from abstract textual cues, intricate pipelines for modeling 3D hand-object correlation, and compounding errors in open-loop prediction. We propose MEgoHand, a multimodal framework that synthesizes physically plausible hand-object interactions from egocentric RGB, text, and initial hand pose. MEgoHand introduces a bi-level architecture: a high-level "cerebrum" leverages a vision language model (VLM) to infer motion priors from visual-textual context and a monocular depth estimator for object-agnostic spatial reasoning, while a low-level DiT-based flow-matching policy generates fine-grained trajectories with temporal orthogonal filtering to enhance stability. To address dataset inconsistency, we design a dataset curation paradigm with an Inverse MANO Retargeting Network and Virtual RGB-D Renderer, curating a unified dataset of 3.35M RGB-D frames, 24K interactions, and 1.2K objects. Extensive experiments across five in-domain and two cross-domain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MEgoHand, achieving substantial reductions in wrist translation error (86.9%) and joint rotation error (34.1%), highlighting its capacity to accurately model fine-grained hand joint structures and generalize robustly across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods rely heavily on costly human-annotated training datasets, which limits their generalization and causes them to struggle in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, reducing real-world adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose ManipLVM-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that replaces traditional supervision with Reinforcement Learning using Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). By directly optimizing for task-aligned outcomes, our method enhances generalization and physical reasoning while removing the dependence on costly annotations. Specifically, we design two rule-based reward functions targeting key robotic manipulation subtasks: an Affordance Perception Reward to enhance localization of interaction regions, and a Trajectory Match Reward to ensure the physical plausibility of action paths. These rewards provide immediate feedback and impose spatial-logical constraints, encouraging the model to go beyond shallow pattern matching and instead learn deeper, more systematic reasoning about physical interactions.</p></details> | 13pages |

This work investigates the extent to which prominent VLMs exhibit cultural biases by evaluating their performance on an image-based country identification task at a country level. Utilizing the geographically diverse Country211 dataset, we probe several large vision language models (VLMs) under various prompting strategies: open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) including challenging setups like multilingual and adversarial settings. Our analysis aims to uncover disparities in model accuracy across different countries and question formats, providing insights into how training data distribution and evaluation methodologies might influence cultural biases in VLMs. The findings highlight significant variations in performance, suggesting that while VLMs possess considerable visual understanding, they inherit biases from their pre-training data and scale that impact their ability to generalize uniformly across diverse global contexts.</p></details> | 28 pages, 36 figures |

However, this paradigm typically lacks supervision over the thinking process leading to the final outcome.As a result, the model may learn sub-optimal reasoning strategies, which can hinder its generalization ability. In light of this, we propose SophiaVL-R1, as an attempt to add reward signals for the thinking process in this paradigm. To achieve this, we first train a thinking reward model that evaluates the quality of the entire thinking process. Given that the thinking reward may be unreliable for certain samples due to reward hacking, we propose the Trust-GRPO method, which assigns a trustworthiness weight to the thinking reward during training. This weight is computed based on the thinking reward comparison of responses leading to correct answers versus incorrect answers, helping to mitigate the impact of potentially unreliable thinking rewards. Moreover, we design an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces the thinking reward over time, allowing the model to rely more on the accurate rule-based outcome reward in later training stages. Experiments show that our SophiaVL-R1 surpasses a series of reasoning MLLMs on various benchmarks (e.g., MathVisita, MMMU), demonstrating strong reasoning and generalization capabilities. Notably, our SophiaVL-R1-7B even outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-72B on most benchmarks, despite the latter having 10 times more parameters.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework: (1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark, performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI interaction.

| **[Dimple: Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model with Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16990v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose Dimple, the first Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model (DMLLM). We observe that training with a purely discrete diffusion approach leads to significant training instability, suboptimal performance, and severe length bias issues. To address these challenges, we design a novel training paradigm that combines an initial autoregressive phase with a subsequent diffusion phase. This approach yields the Dimple-7B model, trained on the same dataset and using a similar training pipeline as LLaVA-NEXT. Dimple-7B ultimately surpasses LLaVA-NEXT in performance by 3.9%, demonstrating that DMLLM can achieve performance comparable to that of autoregressive models. To improve inference efficiency, we propose a decoding strategy termed confident decoding, which dynamically adjusts the number of tokens generated at each step, significantly reducing the number of generation iterations. In autoregressive models, the number of forward iterations during generation equals the response length. With confident decoding, however, the number of iterations needed by Dimple is even only $\frac{\text{response length}}{3}$. We also re-implement the prefilling technique in autoregressive models and demonstrate that it does not significantly impact performance on most benchmark evaluations, while offering a speedup of 1.5x to 7x. Additionally, we explore Dimple's capability to precisely control its response using structure priors. These priors enable structured responses in a manner distinct from instruction-based or chain-of-thought prompting, and allow fine-grained control over response format and length, which is difficult to achieve in autoregressive models. Overall, this work validates the feasibility and advantages of DMLLM and enhances its inference efficiency and controllability.

Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

| **[Backdoor Cleaning without External Guidance in MLLM Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16916v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) settings, where user-submitted datasets adapt general-purpose models to downstream tasks. This flexibility, however, introduces serious security risks, as malicious fine-tuning can implant backdoors into MLLMs with minimal effort. In this paper, we observe that backdoor triggers systematically disrupt cross-modal processing by causing abnormal attention concentration on non-semantic regions--a phenomenon we term attention collapse. Based on this insight, we propose Believe Your Eyes (BYE), a data filtering framework that leverages attention entropy patterns as self-supervised signals to identify and filter backdoor samples. BYE operates via a three-stage pipeline: (1) extracting attention maps using the fine-tuned model, (2) computing entropy scores and profiling sensitive layers via bimodal separation, and (3) performing unsupervised clustering to remove suspicious samples. Unlike prior defenses, BYE equires no clean supervision, auxiliary labels, or model modifications. Extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and diverse trigger types validate BYE's effectiveness: it achieves near-zero attack success rates while maintaining clean-task performance, offering a robust and generalizable solution against backdoor threats in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Its pictorial ideographic features carry rich cultural and contextual information. However, due to the lack of relevant datasets, research on semantic understanding of Dongba hieroglyphs has progressed slowly. To this end, we constructed \textbf{DongbaMIE} - the first dataset focusing on multimodal information extraction of Dongba pictographs. The dataset consists of images of Dongba hieroglyphic characters and their corresponding semantic annotations in Chinese. It contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level high-quality text-image pairs. The annotations cover four semantic dimensions: object, action, relation and attribute. Systematic evaluation of mainstream multimodal large language models shows that the models are difficult to perform information extraction of Dongba hieroglyphs efficiently under zero-shot and few-shot learning. Although supervised fine-tuning can improve the performance, accurate extraction of complex semantics is still a great challenge at present.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset can be obtained from: https://github.com/thinklis/DongbaMIE</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Perception: High-Resolution Image Perception Meets Visual RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01222v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) image perception remains a key challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper shifts away from prior dedicated heuristic approaches and revisits the most fundamental idea to HR perception by enhancing the long-context capability of MLLMs, driven by recent advances in long-context techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for general LLMs. Towards this end, this paper presents the first study exploring the use of RAG to address HR perception challenges. Specifically, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Perception (RAP), a training-free framework that retrieves and fuses relevant image crops while preserving spatial context using the proposed Spatial-Awareness Layout. To accommodate different tasks, the proposed Retrieved-Exploration Search (RE-Search) dynamically selects the optimal number of crops based on model confidence and retrieval scores. Experimental results on HR benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of RAP, with LLaVA-v1.5-13B achieving a 43% improvement on $V^*$ Bench and 19% on HR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe RLHF-V: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Multi-modal Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17682v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are essential for building general-purpose AI assistants; however, they pose increasing safety risks. How can we ensure safety alignment of MLLMs to prevent undesired behaviors? Going further, it is critical to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to preserve capabilities while meeting safety constraints. Fundamentally, this challenge can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. However, existing datasets have not yet disentangled single preference signals into explicit safety constraints, hindering systematic investigation in this direction. Moreover, it remains an open question whether such constraints can be effectively incorporated into the optimization process for multi-modal models. In this work, we present the first exploration of the Safe RLHF-V -- the first multimodal safety alignment framework. The framework consists of: $\mathbf{(I)}$ BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset featuring dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, supplemented with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe); $\mathbf{(II)}$ Beaver-Guard-V, a multi-level guardrail system to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. Applying the guard model over five rounds of filtering and regeneration significantly enhances the precursor model's overall safety by an average of 40.9%. $\mathbf{(III)}$ Based on dual preference, we initiate the first exploration of multi-modal safety alignment within a constrained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Safe RLHF effectively improves both model helpfulness and safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V enhances model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation. Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in generation.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be available at https://github.com/HJYao00/R1-ShareVL.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Divide and Conquer: A Hybrid Strategy Defeats Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16555v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various fields of society due to their powerful reasoning, understanding, and generation capabilities. However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Far and Clearly: Mitigating Hallucinations in MLLMs with Attention Causal Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16652v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens, overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks. With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Clari...</summary><p>Clarification note for the CVPR 2025 paper (FarSight).

To bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open at https://github.com/Cratileo/D2R.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

Bridging this gap, we propose ALTo, an adaptive length tokenizer for autoregressive mask generation. To achieve this, a novel token length predictor is designed, along with a length regularization term and a differentiable token chunking strategy. We further build ALToLLM that seamlessly integrates ALTo into MLLM. Preferences on the trade-offs between mask quality and efficiency is implemented by group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that ALToLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with adaptive token cost on popular segmentation benchmarks.

| **[Implicit Jailbreak Attacks via Cross-Modal Information Concealment on Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16446v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback. On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChemMLLM: Chemical Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16326v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline (GPT-4o) by 118.9\% (4.27 vs 1.95 property improvement). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bbsbz/ChemMLLM.git.</p></details> | 25 pages |

These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDI-Bench: A Benchmark for General Document Intelligence with Vision and Reasoning Decoupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00063v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks. However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 2.3k images across 9 key scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification and optimization guidance. We evaluate various open-source and closed-source models on GDI-Bench, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning domains, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. To address the diverse tasks and domains in the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI-Model that mitigates catastrophic forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through an intelligence-preserving training strategy, thereby reinforcing the inherent weaknesses of the base model. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and models are or will be open-sourced on https://huggingface.co/GDIBench.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks focus primarily on the evaluation of general-purpose CQA but fail to adequately capture domain-specific challenges. We introduce DomainCQA, a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific CQA benchmarks, and demonstrate its effectiveness by developing AstroChart, a CQA benchmark in the field of astronomy. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs face fundamental challenges in vision-language alignment and domain adaptation, highlighting a critical gap in current benchmarks. By providing a scalable and rigorous framework, DomainCQA enables more precise assessment and improvement of MLLMs for domain-specific applications.</p></details> | 87 pages, 65 figures |
