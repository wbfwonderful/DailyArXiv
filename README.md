| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Structured Keywords](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10653v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in surveillance video using keywords by leveraging foundational models' feature representation generalization capabilities. We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Attribute-based Method for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00789v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) identifies suspicious events in videos, which is critical for crime prevention and homeland security. In this paper, we propose a simple but highly effective VAD method that relies on attribute-based representations. The base version of our method represents every object by its velocity and pose, and computes anomaly scores by density estimation. Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset. Combining our attribute-based representations with an off-the-shelf, pretrained deep representation yields state-of-the-art performance with a $99.1\%, 93.7\%$, and $85.9\%$ AUROC on Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

| **[Distilling Aggregated Knowledge for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02831v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection aims to develop automated models capable of identifying abnormal events in surveillance videos. The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVAD: Detecting Interaction Anomalies in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09733v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video anomaly detection datasets are inadequate for representing complex anomalies that occur due to the interactions between objects. The absence of complex anomalies in previous video anomaly detection datasets affects research by shifting the focus onto simple anomalies. To address this problem, we introduce a new large-scale dataset: ComplexVAD. In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes. With our proposed method and two other state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods, we obtain baseline scores on ComplexVAD and demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing works.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, to appear in WACV Workshop ASTAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Contextual Anomalies by Discovering Consistent Spatial Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08470v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a method for modeling spatial context to enable video anomaly detection. The main idea is to discover regions that share similar object-level activities by clustering joint object attributes using Gaussian mixture models. We demonstrate that this straightforward approach, using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than competing models, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the challenging spatial-context-dependent Street Scene dataset. As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous GNN-based Anomaly Detection on Edge using Efficient Adaptive Knowledge Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09072v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for robust security solutions across various industries has made Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) a critical task in applications such as intelligent surveillance, evidence investigation, and violence detection. Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Fusion and Attention Mechanism for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20455v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) has emerged as a contemporary research direction to identify anomaly events like violence and nudity in videos using only video-level labels. However, this task has substantial challenges, including addressing imbalanced modality information and consistently distinguishing between normal and abnormal features. In this paper, we address these challenges and propose a multi-modal WS-VAD framework to accurately detect anomalies such as violence and nudity. Within the proposed framework, we introduce a new fusion mechanism known as the Cross-modal Fusion Adapter (CFA), which dynamically selects and enhances highly relevant audio-visual features in relation to the visual modality. Additionally, we introduce a Hyperbolic Lorentzian Graph Attention (HLGAtt) to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships between normal and abnormal representations, thereby enhancing feature separation accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets of violence and nudity detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR'24 MULA Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Magnitude-Shape Plot Framework for Anomaly Detection in Crowded Video Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20363v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in crowded video scenes is critical for public safety, enabling timely identification of potential threats. This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quo Vadis, Anomaly Detection? LLMs and VLMs in the Spotlight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18298v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has witnessed significant advancements through the integration of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), addressing critical challenges such as interpretability, temporal reasoning, and generalization in dynamic, open-world scenarios. This paper presents an in-depth review of cutting-edge LLM-/VLM-based methods in 2024, focusing on four key aspects: (i) enhancing interpretability through semantic insights and textual explanations, making visual anomalies more understandable; (ii) capturing intricate temporal relationships to detect and localize dynamic anomalies across video frames; (iii) enabling few-shot and zero-shot detection to minimize reliance on large, annotated datasets; and (iv) addressing open-world and class-agnostic anomalies by using semantic understanding and motion features for spatiotemporal coherence. We highlight their potential to redefine the landscape of VAD. Additionally, we explore the synergy between visual and textual modalities offered by LLMs and VLMs, highlighting their combined strengths and proposing future directions to fully exploit the potential in enhancing video anomaly detection.</p></details> | Research report |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Motion and Appearance Guided Patch Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09026v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent endeavor in one class of video anomaly detection is to leverage diffusion models and posit the task as a generation problem, where the diffusion model is trained to recover normal patterns exclusively, thus reporting abnormal patterns as outliers. Yet, existing attempts neglect the various formations of anomaly and predict normal samples at the feature level regardless that abnormal objects in surveillance videos are often relatively small. To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed, specifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information. We further observe that anomalies in videos manifest themselves as deviations in both appearance and motion. Therefore, we argue that a comprehensive solution must consider both of these aspects simultaneously to achieve accurate frame prediction. To address this, we introduce innovative motion and appearance conditions that are seamlessly integrated into our patch diffusion model. These conditions are designed to guide the model in generating coherent and contextually appropriate predictions for both semantic content and motion relations. Experimental results in four challenging video anomaly detection datasets empirically substantiate the efficacy of our proposed approach, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms most existing methods in detecting abnormal behaviors.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI2025 |
| **[Frequency-Guided Diffusion Model with Perturbation Training for Skeleton-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03044v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is an essential yet challenging open-set task in computer vision, often addressed by leveraging reconstruction as a proxy task. However, existing reconstruction-based methods encounter challenges in two main aspects: (1) limited model robustness for open-set scenarios, (2) and an overemphasis on, but restricted capacity for, detailed motion reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel frequency-guided diffusion model with perturbation training, which enhances the model robustness by perturbation training and emphasizes the principal motion components guided by motion frequencies. Specifically, we first use a trainable generator to produce perturbative samples for perturbation training of the diffusion model. During the perturbation training phase, the model robustness is enhanced and the domain of the reconstructed model is broadened by training against this generator. Subsequently, perturbative samples are introduced for inference, which impacts the reconstruction of normal and abnormal motions differentially, thereby enhancing their separability. Considering that motion details originate from high-frequency information, we propose a masking method based on 2D discrete cosine transform to separate high-frequency information and low-frequency information. Guided by the high-frequency information from observed motion, the diffusion model can focus on generating low-frequency information, and thus reconstructing the motion accurately. Experimental results on five video anomaly detection datasets, including human-related and open-set benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/FGDMAD-Code.</p></details> |  |

| **[Vamba: Understanding Hour-Long Videos with Hybrid Mamba-Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11579v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/Vamba/</p></details> |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multi-granularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms existing training-free approaches on EgoSchema and NExT-QA with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME (average 44 minutes), VideoTree achieves better performance than GPT-4V and many other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; First three authors contributed equally; Project page: https://videotree2024.github.io/</p></details> |

Our method leverages a video-language model trained on alignment, denoising, and generative tasks to learn short-term spatio-temporal and multimodal representations. A task-specific temporal model is then used to capture relationships across entire videos. To achieve comprehensive video-language understanding in the surgical domain, we introduce a data collection and filtering strategy to construct a large-scale pretraining dataset from educational YouTube videos. We then utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning by projecting downstream task annotations from publicly available surgical datasets into the language domain. Extensive experiments in two surgical domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with performance improvements of up to 7% in phase segmentation tasks, 8% in zero-shot phase segmentation, and comparable capabilities to fully-supervised models in few-shot settings. Harnessing our model's capabilities for long-range temporal localization and text generation, we present the first comprehensive solution for dense video captioning (DVC) of surgical videos, addressing this task despite the absence of existing DVC datasets in the surgical domain. We introduce a novel approach to surgical workflow understanding that leverages video-language pretraining, large-scale video pretraining, and optimized fine-tuning. Our method improves performance over state-of-the-art techniques and enables new downstream tasks for surgical video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages main manuscript with 3 figures; 6 pages supplementary material with 3 figures.

A key challenge in such approaches is the difficulty of retaining essential visual and temporal information, constrained by the token limits in Image LLMs. To address this, we propose a two-stage method for selecting query-relevant tokens based on the LLM attention scores: compressing the video sequence and then expanding the sequence. However, during the compression stage, Image LLMs often exhibit a positional attention bias in video sequences, where attention is overly concentrated on later frames, causing early-frame information to be underutilized. To alleviate this attention bias during sequence compression, we propose Gridded Attention Pooling for preserving spatiotemporal structure. Additionally, we introduce Visual Summarization Tail to effectively utilize this bias, facilitating overall video understanding during sequence expansion. In this way, our method effectively Mitigates and Leverages attention Bias (LLaVA-MLB), enabling the frozen Image LLM for detailed video understanding. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

LLaVA-Octopus adaptively weights features from different visual projectors based on user instructions, enabling us to leverage the complementary strengths of each projector. We observe that different visual projectors exhibit distinct characteristics when handling specific tasks. For instance, some projectors excel at capturing static details, while others are more effective at processing temporal information, and some are better suited for tasks requiring temporal coherence. By dynamically adjusting feature weights according to user instructions, LLaVA-Octopus dynamically selects and combines the most suitable features, significantly enhancing the model's performance in multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-Octopus achieves excellent performance across multiple benchmarks, especially in tasks such as video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

However, these models often struggle with basic image transformations. This paper investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically CLIP by OpenAI and SigLIP by Google. Our findings reveal that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. To facilitate this study, we created an augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. We further explore how this deficiency impacts downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 images |
| **[Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning: Enhancing Efficiency of Large Vision Language Models on Long-Form Video Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10742v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are you Struggling? Dataset and Baselines for Struggle Determination in Assembly Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11057v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining when people are struggling from video enables a finer-grained understanding of actions and opens opportunities for building intelligent support visual interfaces. In this paper, we present a new dataset with three assembly activities and corresponding performance baselines for the determination of struggle from video. Three real-world problem-solving activities including assembling plumbing pipes (Pipes-Struggle), pitching camping tents (Tent-Struggle) and solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle (Tower-Struggle) are introduced. Video segments were scored w.r.t. the level of struggle as perceived by annotators using a forced choice 4-point scale. Each video segment was annotated by a single expert annotator in addition to crowd-sourced annotations. The dataset is the first struggle annotation dataset and contains 5.1 hours of video and 725,100 frames from 73 participants in total. We evaluate three decision-making tasks: struggle classification, struggle level regression, and struggle label distribution learning. We provide baseline results for each of the tasks utilising several mainstream deep neural networks, along with an ablation study and visualisation of results. Our work is motivated toward assistive systems that analyze struggle, support users during manual activities and encourage learning, as well as other video understanding competencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaVChat: Unlocking Fine-Grained Facial Video Understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09158v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based multimodal large language models (VMLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in cross-modal video understanding. However, their abilities in fine-grained face comprehension remain largely underexplored. Given its pivotal role in human-centric intelligence, developing VMLLMs for facial understanding holds a fundamental problem. To address this gap, we propose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial video understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale facial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated with 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to enrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs and an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To effectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture composed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a mixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual features. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we extract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate them into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to comprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details. We employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video summarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task complexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluation on a couple of public benchmarks, demonstrating that FaVChat consistently surpasses existing VMLLMs across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIME: Temporal-sensitive Multi-dimensional Instruction Tuning and Benchmarking for Video-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09994v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as video question answering, however, their temporal understanding remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching VLMs to Localize Specific Objects from In-context Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13317v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse visual tasks, including image recognition, video understanding, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) when explicitly trained for these tasks. Despite these advances, we find that present-day VLMs (including the proprietary GPT-4o) lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize specific objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. Personalized localization can be particularly important in cases of ambiguity of several related objects that can respond to a text or an object that is hard to describe with words. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances the few-shot localization performance of recent VLMs ranging from 7B to 72B in size, without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored towards evaluating personalized localization abilities. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs -- exposing critical weaknesses in present-day VLMs, and laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLog: Video-Language Models by Generative Retrieval of Narration Vocabulary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09402v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human daily activities can be concisely narrated as sequences of routine events (e.g., turning off an alarm) in video streams, forming an event vocabulary. Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's efficient similarity search. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

| **[VideoScan: Enabling Efficient Streaming Video Understanding via Frame-level Semantic Carriers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09387v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VideoScan, an efficient vision-language model (VLM) inference framework designed for real-time video interaction that effectively comprehends and retains streamed video inputs while delivering rapid and accurate responses. A longstanding challenge in video understanding--particularly for long-term or real-time applications--stems from the substantial computational overhead caused by the extensive length of visual tokens. To address this, VideoScan employs a single semantic carrier token to represent each frame, progressively reducing computational and memory overhead during its two-phase inference process: prefilling and decoding. The embedding of the semantic carrier token is derived from an optimized aggregation of frame-level visual features, ensuring compact yet semantically rich representations. Critically, the corresponding key-value pairs are trained to retain contextual semantics from prior frames, enabling efficient memory management without sacrificing temporal coherence. During inference, the visual tokens of each frame are processed only once during the prefilling phase and subsequently discarded in the decoding stage, eliminating redundant computations. This design ensures efficient VLM inference even under stringent real-time constraints. Comprehensive experiments on diverse offline and online benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Video, supported by our method, achieves up to $\sim 5\times$ and $1.29\times$ speedups compared to its original version and previous efficient streaming video understanding approaches, respectively. Crucially, these improvements are attained while maintaining competitive performance and ensuring stable GPU memory consumption (consistently $\sim 18$GB, independent of video duration).</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, traditional RAG methods remain fundamentally limited due to their dependence on explicit search queries, which are unavailable in many situations. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel RAG-based LVU approach inspired by the cognitive memory of human beings, which is called MemVid. Our approach operates with four basics steps: memorizing holistic video information, reasoning about the task's information needs based on the memory, retrieving critical moments based on the information needs, and focusing on the retrieved moments to produce the final answer. To enhance the system's memory-grounded reasoning capabilities and achieve optimal end-to-end performance, we propose a curriculum learning strategy. This approach begins with supervised learning on well-annotated reasoning results, then progressively explores and reinforces more plausible reasoning outcomes through reinforcement learning. We perform extensive evaluations on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, VideoMME and LVBench. In our experiment, MemVid significantly outperforms existing RAG-based methods and popular LVU models, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our model and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, VILA-40B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art results on long-form video benchmarks: LLaVA-Video-72B reaches 66.8 (+4.3) on LongVideoBench and 77.0 (+2.7) on MLVU, while Aria obtains 39.2 on HourVideo surpassing the Gemini-1.5-pro by 1.9 points.

Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique aspects of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D. Our approach features a progressive training pipeline with three stages: Teacher Self-Preparation, Teacher-Student Guidance, and Student Self-Practice. Additionally, we propose an instruction-tuning data EgoIT from multiple sources to strengthen the model's instruction-following capabilities, along with the EgoBench benchmark comprising eight different tasks for thorough evaluation. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://egovisiongroup.github.io/Exo2Ego.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing methods struggle with retrieving cross-modal information from long videos, especially when relevant details are sparsely distributed. We introduce UMaT (Unified Multi-modal as Text), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that efficiently processes extremely long videos while maintaining cross-modal coherence. UMaT converts visual and auditory data into a unified textual representation, ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. Short video clips are analyzed using a vision-language model, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes dialogue. These text-based representations are structured into temporally aligned segments, with adaptive filtering to remove redundancy and retain salient details. The processed data is embedded into a vector database, enabling precise retrieval of dispersed yet relevant content. Experiments on a benchmark LVQA dataset show that UMaT outperforms existing methods in multimodal integration, long-form video understanding, and sparse information retrieval. Its scalability and interpretability allow it to process videos over an hour long while maintaining semantic and temporal coherence. These findings underscore the importance of structured retrieval and multimodal synchronization for advancing LVQA and long-form AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize object and action recognition, often neglecting the intricate nuances of human emotions, behaviors, and speech-visual alignment within video content. We present HumanVBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to bridge these gaps in the evaluation of video MLLMs. HumanVBench comprises 16 carefully designed tasks that explore two primary dimensions: inner emotion and outer manifestations, spanning static and dynamic, basic and complex, as well as single-modal and cross-modal aspects. With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 22 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and emotion perception, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding. HumanVBench is open-sourced to facilitate future advancements and real-world applications in video MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing defense methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) They solely focus on textual defenses, fail to directly address threats in the visual domain where attacks originate, and (2) the additional processing steps often incur significant computational overhead or compromise model performance on benign tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ESIII (Embedding Security Instructions Into Images), a novel methodology for transforming the visual space from a source of vulnerability into an active defense mechanism. Initially, we embed security instructions into defensive images through gradient-based optimization, obtaining security instructions in the visual dimension. Subsequently, we integrate security instructions from visual and textual dimensions with the input query. The collaboration between security instructions from different dimensions ensures comprehensive security protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively fortifies the robustness of LVLMs against such attacks while preserving their performance on standard benign tasks and incurring an imperceptible increase in time costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Two Stages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11609v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An old-school recipe for training a classifier is to (i) learn a good feature extractor and (ii) optimize a linear layer atop. When only a handful of samples are available per category, as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA), data are insufficient to fit a large number of parameters, rendering the above impractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by analyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot data from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We show that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i) task-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available concepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or adapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed computational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature extractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this scheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established methods, our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category level, i.e., at test time, only novel categories are embedded by the adapted text encoder, while embeddings of base categories are available within the classifier. Results with fixed hyperparameters across two settings, three backbones, and eleven datasets, show that 2SFS matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art, while established methods degrade significantly across settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CVPR 2025 (w/ SuppMat, 23 pages)</p></details> |

Our model comprehensively processes entire pages by generating DocTags, a new universal markup format that captures all page elements in their full context with location. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large foundational models, or ensemble solutions that rely on handcrafted pipelines of multiple specialized models, SmolDocling offers an end-to-end conversion for accurately capturing content, structure and spatial location of document elements in a 256M parameters vision-language model. SmolDocling exhibits robust performance in correctly reproducing document features such as code listings, tables, equations, charts, lists, and more across a diverse range of document types including business documents, academic papers, technical reports, patents, and forms -- significantly extending beyond the commonly observed focus on scientific papers. Additionally, we contribute novel publicly sourced datasets for charts, tables, equations, and code recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SmolDocling competes with other Vision Language Models that are up to 27 times larger in size, while reducing computational requirements substantially. The model is currently available, datasets will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

While token pruning offers a promising solution, existing methods often introduce training overhead or fail to adapt dynamically across layers. We present SAINT, a training-free token pruning framework that leverages token similarity and a graph-based formulation to dynamically optimize pruning rates and redundancy thresholds. Through systematic analysis, we identify a universal three-stage token evolution process (aligner-explorer-aggregator) in transformers, enabling aggressive pruning in early stages without sacrificing critical information. For ViTs, SAINT doubles the throughput of ViT-H/14 at 224px with only 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet-1K, surpassing the closest competitor by 0.8%. For VLMs, we apply SAINT in three modes: ViT-only, LLM-only, and hybrid. SAINT reduces LLaVA-13B's tokens by 75%, achieving latency comparable to LLaVA-7B with less than 1% performance loss across benchmarks. Our work establishes a unified, practical framework for efficient inference in ViTs and VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-vision, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), tasks have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I GMs are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to generate disruptive outputs semantically related to those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of VLP tasks when injected into images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs. To better observe performance modifications and characteristics of this threat, we also introduce the TVPI Dataset. Through extensive explorations, we deepen the understanding of the underlying causes of the TVPI threat in various GMs and offer valuable insights into its potential origins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20292v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have made breakthroughs by incorporating material decomposition in the 3D generation pipeline, they tend to bake highlights into albedo and ignore spatially varying properties of metallicity and roughness. In this work, we present PBR3DGen, a two-stage mesh generation method with high-quality PBR materials that integrates the novel multi-view PBR material estimation model and a 3D PBR mesh reconstruction model. Specifically, PBR3DGen leverages vision language models (VLM) to guide multi-view diffusion, precisely capturing the spatial distribution and inherent attributes of reflective-metalness material. Additionally, we incorporate view-dependent illumination-aware conditions as pixel-aware priors to enhance spatially varying material properties. Furthermore, our reconstruction model reconstructs high-quality mesh with PBR materials. Experimental results demonstrate that PBR3DGen significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results for PBR estimation and mesh generation.

To address these limitations, we introduce PARIC, a probabilistic framework for guiding visual attention via language specifications. Our approach enables pre-trained vision-language models to generate probabilistic reference attention maps, which align textual and visual modalities more effectively while incorporating uncertainty estimates, as compared to their deterministic counterparts. Experiments on benchmark test problems demonstrate that PARIC enhances prediction accuracy, mitigates bias, ensures consistent predictions, and improves robustness across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Road Rage Reasoning with Vision-language Models (VLMs): Task Definition and Evaluation Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11342v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road rage, triggered by driving-related stimuli such as traffic congestion and aggressive driving, poses a significant threat to road safety. Previous research on road rage regulation has primarily focused on response suppression, lacking proactive prevention capabilities. With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it has become possible to reason about trigger events visually and then engage in dialog-based comforting before drivers' anger escalates. To this end, we propose the road rage reasoning task, along with a finely annotated test dataset and evaluation metrics, to assess the capabilities of current mainstream VLMs in scene understanding, event recognition, and road rage reasoning. The results indicate that current VLMs exhibit significant shortcomings in scene understanding within the visual modality, as well as in comprehending the spatial relationships between objects in the textual modality. Improving VLMs' performance in these areas will greatly benefit downstream tasks like antecedent-focused road rage regulation.</p></details> |  |

Although this approach aids in concentrating on salient features and diminishing computational burden, it incurs the loss of vital detailed information, a drawback that is particularly damaging in end-to-end autonomous driving scenarios. Downsampling can lead to an inadequate capture of distant or small objects such as pedestrians, road signs, or obstacles, all of which are crucial for safe navigation. This loss of features negatively impacts an autonomous driving system's capacity to accurately perceive the environment, potentially escalating the risk of accidents. To tackle this problem, we put forward the Dynamic Resolution Vision Language Model (DynRsl-VLM). DynRsl-VLM incorporates a dynamic resolution image input processing approach that captures all entity feature information within an image while ensuring that the image input remains computationally tractable for the Vision Transformer (ViT). Moreover, we devise a novel image-text alignment module to replace the Q-Former, enabling simple and efficient alignment with text when dealing with dynamic resolution image inputs. Our method enhances the environmental perception capabilities of autonomous driving systems without overstepping computational constraints.</p></details> |  |

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses based on the predicted concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports test-time human intervention, enabling corrections to predicted concepts, which improves final diagnoses and enhances transparency in decision-making. We validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few annotated examples.

However, CER faces challenges due to the complexity of facial expressions and the difficulty of capturing subtle emotional cues. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Our method employs a two-stage fine-tuning process: first, pre-trained LVLMs are fine-tuned on basic facial expressions to establish foundational patterns; second, the model is further optimized on a compound-expression dataset to refine visual-language feature interactions. Our approach achieves advanced accuracy on the RAF-DB dataset and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on the C-EXPR-DB dataset, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in emotion analysis and human-computer interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skip Tuning: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models are Effective and Efficient Adapters Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11509v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning (PT) has long been recognized as an effective and efficient paradigm for transferring large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by learning a tiny set of context vectors. Nevertheless, in this work, we reveal that freezing the parameters of VLMs during learning the context vectors neither facilitates the transferability of pre-trained knowledge nor improves the memory and time efficiency significantly. Upon further investigation, we find that reducing both the length and width of the feature-gradient propagation flows of the full fine-tuning (FT) baseline is key to achieving effective and efficient knowledge transfer. Motivated by this, we propose Skip Tuning, a novel paradigm for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. Unlike existing PT or adapter-based methods, Skip Tuning applies Layer-wise Skipping (LSkip) and Class-wise Skipping (CSkip) upon the FT baseline without introducing extra context vectors or adapter modules. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our Skip Tuning over both PT and adapter-based methods.

To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Assembly of Global and Local Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12718v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite great success across various multimodal tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often encounter object hallucinations with generated textual responses being inconsistent with the actual objects in images. We examine different LVLMs and pinpoint that one root cause of object hallucinations lies with deficient attention on discriminative image features. Specifically, LVLMs often predominantly attend to prompt-irrelevant global features instead of prompt-relevant local features, undermining their visual grounding capacity and leading to object hallucinations. We propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates hallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are suppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit distribution that is from generative global features of the original image and discriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

In this work, we introduce \textit{Poisoned-MRAG}, the first knowledge poisoning attack on multimodal RAG systems. Poisoned-MRAG injects a few carefully crafted image-text pairs into the multimodal knowledge database, manipulating VLMs to generate the attacker-desired response to a target query. Specifically, we formalize the attack as an optimization problem and propose two cross-modal attack strategies, dirty-label and clean-label, tailored to the attacker's knowledge and goals. Our extensive experiments across multiple knowledge databases and VLMs show that Poisoned-MRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98\% attack success rate with just five malicious image-text pairs injected into the InfoSeek database (481,782 pairs). Additionally, We evaluate 4 different defense strategies, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal, structure-driven mitigation, and purification, demonstrating their limited effectiveness and trade-offs against Poisoned-MRAG. Our results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of Poisoned-MRAG, underscoring its potential as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Vision Language Models with Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15432v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Accepted |

However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, eg, image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP50 over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model.

While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations to insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that hallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during decoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs' visual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less discriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating broader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to hallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive instruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a novel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and Disentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling LVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID consists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies Attention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next, Attention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of these identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on subsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between instruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces hallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

| **[Filter, Correlate, Compress: Training-Free Token Reduction for MLLM Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17686v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, hindering their real-world deployment. While existing training-free token reduction methods aim to address these inefficiencies, how to precisely identify redundant visual tokens and recover the essential information from the discarded tokens remain unclear. In this paper, we propose a ''filter-correlate-compress'' framework that decomposes the token reduction into three stages: filtering redundant tokens, correlating discarded information to preserved tokens, and compressing tokens to minimize redundancy. Following the framework, we propose a solution FiCoCo to identify limitations in single redundancy assessment, propose adaptive strategies to retain critical information from discarded tokens, and mitigate semantic dilution during token fusion. Two specialized variants, FiCoCo-V (for vision encoders) and FiCoCo-L (for LLM decoders), further optimize efficiency across MLLM architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FiCoCo achieves up to 5.7x/14.7x FLOPs reduction with 92.8%/93.6% performance retention on LLaVA-1.5-7B/LLaVA-NeXT-7B. Our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art training-free approaches, showcasing effectiveness and generalizability across model architectures, sizes, and tasks without requiring retraining.

Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

Their integration into autonomous driving systems shows promising results in isolated proof-of-concept applications, while their performance is evaluated on selective singular aspects of perception, reasoning, or planning. To leverage their full potential a systematic framework for evaluating MLLMs in the context of autonomous driving is required. This paper proposes a holistic framework for a capability-driven evaluation of MLLMs in autonomous driving. The framework structures scenario understanding along the four core capability dimensions semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical. They are derived from the general requirements of autonomous driving systems, human driver cognition, and language-based reasoning. It further organises the domain into context layers, processing modalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and decision-making. To illustrate the framework's applicability, two exemplary traffic scenarios are analysed, grounding the proposed dimensions in realistic driving situations. The framework provides a foundation for the structured evaluation of MLLMs' potential for scenario understanding in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IAVVC 2025, Under Review</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, Open3DVQA, to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capacities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models in open 3D space. Open3DVQA consists of 9k VQA samples, collected using an efficient semi-automated tool in a high-fidelity urban simulator. We evaluate several SOTA MLLMs across various aspects of spatial reasoning, such as relative and absolute spatial relationships, situational reasoning, and object-centric spatial attributes. Our results reveal that: 1) MLLMs perform better at answering questions regarding relative spatial relationships than absolute spatial relationships, 2) MLLMs demonstrate similar spatial reasoning abilities for both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and 3) Fine-tuning large models significantly improves their performance across different spatial reasoning tasks. We believe that our open-source data collection tools and in-depth analyses will inspire further research on MLLM spatial reasoning capabilities.

Despite recent advancements, existing datasets often lack breadth and depth, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments: (1) from a breadth perspective, current datasets are constrained to limited variations of objects in specific scenes, and (2) from a depth perspective, prior benchmarks often provide overly simplistic descriptions. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniDiff, a comprehensive dataset comprising 324 diverse scenarios-spanning real-world complex environments and 3D synthetic settings-with fine-grained human annotations averaging 60 words in length and covering 12 distinct change types. Building on this foundation, we propose M$^3$Diff, a MultiModal large language model enhanced by a plug-and-play Multi-scale Differential Perception (MDP) module. This module improves the model's ability to accurately identify and describe inter-image differences while maintaining the foundational model's generalization capabilities. With the addition of the OmniDiff dataset, M$^3$Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Spot-the-Diff, IEdit, CLEVR-Change, CLEVR-DC, and OmniDiff, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-scenario difference recognition accuracy compared to existing methods.

To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications.

Creating aesthetically pleasing banner designs while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large search space involving multiple design elements. Additionally, advertisers need multiple sizes for different displays and various versions to target different sectors of audiences. Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective process, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While current models have served as assistants to human designers in various design tasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or produce pixel-based outputs that limit editability. This paper introduces a training-free framework for fully automated banner ad design creation, enabling frontier multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to streamline the production of effective banners with minimal manual effort across diverse marketing contexts. We present BannerAgency, an MLLM agent system that collaborates with advertisers to understand their brand identity and banner objectives, generates matching background images, creates blueprints for foreground design elements, and renders the final creatives as editable components in Figma or SVG formats rather than static pixels. To facilitate evaluation and future research, we introduce BannerRequest400, a benchmark featuring 100 unique logos paired with 400 diverse banner requests. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, emphasizing the quality of the generated banner designs, their adaptability to various banner requests, and their strong editability enabled by this component-based approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartMoE: Mixture of Diversely Aligned Expert Connector for Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03277v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, current MLLMs still struggle to provide faithful data and reliable analysis only based on charts. To address it, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train several linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with nearly 1 million chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts diversely and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48\% to 84.64\% on the ChartQA benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Inference Adaptively for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10905v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs.Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Before You Segment: High-Quality Reasoning Segmentation with GPT Chain of Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07503v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation is a challenging vision-language task that aims to output the segmentation mask with respect to a complex, implicit, and even non-visual query text. Previous works incorporated multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with segmentation models to approach the difficult problem. However, their segmentation quality often falls short in complex cases, particularly when dealing with out-of-domain objects with intricate structures, blurry boundaries, occlusions, or high similarity with surroundings. In this paper, we introduce ThinkFirst, a training-free reasoning segmentation framework that leverages GPT's chain of thought to address these challenging cases. Our approach allows GPT-4o or other powerful MLLMs to generate a detailed, chain-of-thought description of an image. This summarized description is then passed to a language-instructed segmentation assistant to aid the segmentation process. Our framework allows users to easily interact with the segmentation agent using multimodal inputs, such as easy text and image scribbles, for successive refinement or communication. We evaluate the performance of ThinkFirst on diverse objects. Extensive experiments show that, this zero-shot-CoT approach significantly improves the vanilla reasoning segmentation agent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while being less sensitive or critical to user-supplied prompts after Thinking First.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~skao/thinkfirst.html</p></details> |
| **[GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10639v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and models are released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT</p></details> |

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively. We will release the code, datasets, and benchmark.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[TokenCarve: Information-Preserving Visual Token Compression in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10501v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming increasingly popular, while the high computational cost associated with multimodal data input, particularly from visual tokens, poses a significant challenge. Existing training-based token compression methods improve inference efficiency but require costly retraining, while training-free methods struggle to maintain performance when aggressively reducing token counts. In this study, we reveal that the performance degradation of MLLM closely correlates with the accelerated loss of information in the attention output matrix. This insight introduces a novel information-preserving perspective, making it possible to maintain performance even under extreme token compression. Based on this finding, we propose TokenCarve, a training-free, plug-and-play, two-stage token compression framework. The first stage employs an Information-Preservation-Guided Selection (IPGS) strategy to prune low-information tokens, while the second stage further leverages IPGS to guide token merging, minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets and 2 model variants demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenCarve. It can even reduce the number of visual tokens to 22.2% of the original count, achieving a 1.23x speedup in inference, a 64% reduction in KV cache storage, and only a 1.54% drop in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShawnTan86/TokenCarve.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D LangSplat: 4D Language Gaussian Splatting via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10437v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive, open-ended language queries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisualPRM: An Effective Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10291v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VisualPRM, an advanced multimodal Process Reward Model (PRM) with 8B parameters, which improves the reasoning abilities of existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across different model scales and families with Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies. Specifically, our model improves the reasoning performance of three types of MLLMs and four different model scales. Even when applied to the highly capable InternVL2.5-78B, it achieves a 5.9-point improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our model exhibits superior performance compared to Outcome Reward Models and Self-Consistency during BoN evaluation. To facilitate the training of multimodal PRMs, we construct a multimodal process supervision dataset VisualPRM400K using an automated data pipeline. For the evaluation of multimodal PRMs, we propose VisualProcessBench, a benchmark with human-annotated step-wise correctness labels, to measure the abilities of PRMs to detect erroneous steps in multimodal reasoning tasks. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the development of MLLMs. Our model, data, and benchmark are released in https://internvl.github.io/blog/2025-03-13-VisualPRM/.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaVChat: Unlocking Fine-Grained Facial Video Understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09158v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based multimodal large language models (VMLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in cross-modal video understanding. However, their abilities in fine-grained face comprehension remain largely underexplored. Given its pivotal role in human-centric intelligence, developing VMLLMs for facial understanding holds a fundamental problem. To address this gap, we propose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial video understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale facial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated with 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to enrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs and an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To effectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture composed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a mixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual features. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we extract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate them into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to comprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details. We employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video summarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task complexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluation on a couple of public benchmarks, demonstrating that FaVChat consistently surpasses existing VMLLMs across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
